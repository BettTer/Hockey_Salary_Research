I haven't seen much of you guys this season, aside from the standings, but it seems like your coach? has turned the team around. Aside from the 2nd half of the 3rd period, it was a well played, hard fought match. And I enjoyed it immensely.

I honestly expected the Rangers to lose tonight after watching the 1st half of the game. You guys are relentless, no matter what, and I respect that.  

Just one of the many things I love about the NHL. Any team can beat any team on any given night.

The only reason he won 2 more Cups after 2009 was because the NHL wanted him to take back his golden boy status when Toews and Kane led the Blackhawks to 3 Cups in 6 years while Crosby and his Penguins have only won 1 Cup as the supposed next dynasty. Look who his team beat in the Finals: Sharks and Predators. Not exactly something to brag about when all the Cup winners since then have beaten way better teams: VGK, Bruins, Stars, Lightning that was supposed to threepeat and Panthers. Not counting the Canadiens in here because it was a fluke. Talk to me when Crosby can win in the playoffs by beating Shesterkin, Konecny, Matthews, McDavid, M.

Their special teams have been top 5 for each and a dangerous PP and OT excellence are all you need to make a deep playoff run. With 7 games left on their schedule after Arizona against teams they could easily beat like Pittsburgh and New Jersey, they should win the Metro and the East at this rate.

Even with all the moves other playoff teams have made at the deadline in hopes of beating New York in the playoffs, this doesn't seem possible right now with how good they've been. They should have a clear path to represent the Metro in the ECF since the Canes, Flyers, Caps are very flawed while Tampa Bay, Florida and Boston are highly overrated. 

Quick and Igor are already unbeatable in the regular season. Imagine being the team to face them in the playoffs. Ha. And you also have to face a top 10 defense and offense in the NHL.

Words can not describe how much funnier the NHL is to follow when it's during a high scoring era like we are seeing right now. For example, during the low scoring eras you never see people chasing scoring records. This season we have already seen several, MacKinnon going for the home streak record and McDavid going for the 100 assist mark (not a record but you get what I mean). Not to mention the games just being more fun to watch in general. Seeing multiple players with >1.5ppg is just objectively fun.

* The Bruins, having clinched a playoff spot after a remarkable regular season, face the challenge of preparing for the postseason with the aim of overcoming past disappointments. Despite not being considered the favorites, the team has the internal expectation of winning their first championship since 2011. Coach Jim Montgomery and captain Brad Marchand emphasize the importance of playing the right way and maintaining consistent preparation to ensure they are ready for the intense competition of the playoffs.

I'm new to the sport betting I figured I know enough when to throw a team with high reward for a win,  it's worth it like my friends back home favorites the ny islanders were facing the high volatile Florida panthers, I knew Bob panthers starter lost 6 last starts, but the back won his last 6, I don't think the panthers play as good as most think really no depth on other line 1. Now the islanders chasing the wildcard (I want them to make it, I enjoy when my friends are happy) but you got Detroit Red wing's who recently lost 7 games so that a possible of 14 points! If they won all that's 93 pts, or even 3 of 7 for 6pts would be 1 behind tampa bay lightning @ 86 for the 2nd or last wild card and 3-5 pts from 3 place..anyway my friends ol islanders are in desperate need to take advantage of the Detroit Red wing's mediocre offense and goaltending..this is the time to keep winning fuck the red wings as much as I'd hate to see Washington Capital's get removed from the wild card spot, I don't think the ones the call NY Rangers of the South, Tampa bay shouldn't be knocked also Carolina hurricanes are also a team who would normally use alot of ex rangers its weird but they won't catch Toronto Mapleleafs or do we call them a 4 man show(Mathews, Nylander, Marner, Tavares) let me show an insane stat - accounted for a total of $40,489,366 of the Leafs' salary cap. It was a staggering 49.7 percent. For just 4 players! I feel the leaf fans frustration so say 80million was the cap for signings that's insane 4 players take 40,500,000 out of a 23 man roster that leaves 19 players to figure out the other 51% I can understand the leaf fans frustration, a team wins the cup, atleast 3 lines, can get away with a bad or okay 4th line, but what about defense only 3 I have heard up with a solid d man at 40yr old(Giordano) basically a waste of a possible playoff team....I may bite my words but even with a round 1 win they absolutely won't be able to win this cup..so since the islanders won me some money and I would love to see a eastern conference final NY Islanders vs NY Rangers...I'll keep betting on my friends from home's team most games are under dogs...win you silly team! As a rangers fan I remember 1994 atleast first 2 periods my dad woke me up screaming yes yes yes! I want my friends born in the early 80 mid 80s to see them hoist a cup for you islanders fans too! And I'm going to throw a future prediction ok so first one if Connor McDavid doesn't win a cup with the Oilers, some time in the future he signs with the rangers ( only if they don't end up winning a cup by then) another is if the rangers win a cup by the time mathews is a free agent he will definitely go to the rangers",2024-03-30 08:14:02,2024-03-30,new

I don't mind taking that argument seriously if it's true, but what do you think?

Is there something to do with this era and the way that defenses etc. play that makes it easier to score?

Or have players just gotten more skilled at scoring?


I personally can't think of any reason why defenses would have gotten worse overall as the league developed so I have to assume it's the second, but if anyone thinks it's the first and would like to explain why, I'd be interested.",2024-03-30 03:39:18,2024-03-30,new

At the rate he is going he is going to win the Art Ross, while being only the 4th player ever to put up 100+ assists, hes on pace for 110 (the other two being Gretzky, Lemieux and Orr). He also became just the 3rd player ever to record 50 primary assists in 50 or less games (49). The other two being Gretzky and Lemieux. Voter fatigue is a real thing though.

MacKinnon has been phenomenal and he benefits from the fact that he's never won it and people just want to see it happen. I do believe he is the least deserving (despite being incredible) but these things do play a factor.

Matthews is unbelievable, I think he needs to get to 70 to even have a chance to win it though, otherwise he is my fourth place vote here. Which is unfortunate given how great he's been.

Kuch could possibly join Connor in the 100 assist club (however unlikely). Even coming close is amazing though. Also, you have to consider his team. It is the MVP and he is absolutely carrying them. The difference between him and the second highest scorer is unreal. He is my very close second.

I've searched and haven't found a definitive answer. Rule 60.2 specifically states that High Sticking applies if a stick makes contact with an opponent above the shoulders. But do all penalties have to be committed against an opponent?

I love Hockey and I watch it a lot. I'm pretty sure that I have never seen it happen if it can happen.

Kucherov has 126 points in 72 games with 9 remaining

He noted how the groundwork for success had been laid in Boston, contrasting with the team in Anaheim where he and his teammates were working to establish a similar standard.
* The Bruins, having clinched a playoff spot after a remarkable regular season, face the challenge of preparing for the postseason with the aim of overcoming past disappointments. Despite not being considered the favorites, the team has the internal expectation of winning their first championship since 2011. Coach Jim Montgomery and captain Brad Marchand emphasize the importance of playing the right way and maintaining consistent preparation to ensure they are ready for the intense competition of the playoffs.

I don't mind taking that argument seriously if it's true, but what do you think?

Is there something to do with this era and the way that defenses etc. play that makes it easier to score?

Or have players just gotten more skilled at scoring?

With 7 games left on their schedule after Arizona against teams they could easily beat like Pittsburgh and New Jersey, they should win the Metro and the East at this rate.

Even with all the moves other playoff teams have made at the deadline in hopes of beating New York in the playoffs, this doesn't seem possible right now with how good they've been. They should have a clear path to represent the Metro in the ECF since the Canes, Flyers, Caps are very flawed while Tampa Bay, Florida and Boston are highly overrated. 

Quick and Igor are already unbeatable in the regular season. Imagine being the team to face them in the playoffs. Ha. And you also have to face a top 10 defense and offense in the NHL. Good luck in the playoffs. New York has come to play and dominate the competition.

The only reason he won 2 more Cups after 2009 was because the NHL wanted him to take back his golden boy status when Toews and Kane led the Blackhawks to 3 Cups in 6 years while Crosby and his Penguins have only won 1 Cup as the supposed next dynasty. Look who his team beat in the Finals: Sharks and Predators. Not exactly something to brag about when all the Cup winners since then have beaten way better teams: VGK, Bruins, Stars, Lightning that was supposed to threepeat and Panthers. Not counting the Canadiens in here because it was a fluke. Talk to me when Crosby can win in the playoffs by beating Shesterkin, Konecny, Matthews, McDavid, M.

"The Hart race. You could make a solid argument for McDavid, MacKinnon, Kucherov or Matthews. What's your stance?",https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1bqwk6l/the_hart_race_you_could_make_a_solid_argument_for/,3,nhl,"Personally, I say McDavid. At the rate he is going he is going to win the Art Ross, while being only the 4th player ever to put up 100+ assists, hes on pace for 110 (the other two being Gretzky, Lemieux and Orr). He also became just the 3rd player ever to record 50 primary assists in 50 or less games (49). The other two being Gretzky and Lemieux. Voter fatigue is a real thing though.

MacKinnon has been phenomenal and he benefits from the fact that he's never won it and people just want to see it happen. I do believe he is the least deserving (despite being incredible) but these things do play a factor.

Matthews is unbelievable, I think he needs to get to 70 to even have a chance to win it though, otherwise he is my fourth place vote here. Which is unfortunate given how great he's been.

Kuch could possibly join Connor in the 100 assist club (however unlikely). Even coming close is amazing though. Also, you have to consider his team. It is the MVP and he is absolutely carrying them. The difference between him and the second highest scorer is unreal. He is my very close second.

I wouldn't be shocked or offended with any result here. They have all been just unreal. Just curious to hear other people's thoughts.",2024-03-29 18:33:19,2024-03-29,hot

Long



I'm new to the sport betting I figured I know enough when to throw a team with high reward for a win,  it's worth it like my friends back home favorites the ny islanders were facing the high volatile Florida panthers, I knew Bob panthers starter lost 6 last starts, but the back won his last 6, I don't think the panthers play as good as most think really no depth on other line 1. Now the islanders chasing the wildcard (I want them to make it, I enjoy when my friends are happy) but you got Detroit Red wing's who recently lost 7 games so that a possible of 14 points! If they won all that's 93 pts, or even 3 of 7 for 6pts would be 1 behind tampa bay lightning @ 86 for the 2nd or last wild card and 3-5 pts from 3 place..anyway my friends ol islanders are in desperate need to take advantage of the Detroit Red wing's mediocre offense and goaltending..this is the time to keep winning fuck the red wings as much as I'd hate to see Washington Capital's get removed from the wild card spot, I don't think the ones the call NY Rangers of the South, Tampa bay shouldn't be knocked also Carolina hurricanes are also a team who would normally use alot of ex rangers its weird but they won't catch Toronto Mapleleafs or do we call them a 4 man show(Mathews, Nylander, Marner, Tavares) let me show an insane stat - accounted for a total of $40,489,366 of the Leafs' salary cap. It was a staggering 49.7 percent. For just 4 players! I feel the leaf fans frustration so say 80million was the cap for signings that's insane 4 players take 40,500,000 out of a 23 man roster that leaves 19 players to figure out the other 51% I can understand the leaf fans frustration, a team wins the cup, atleast 3 lines, can get away with a bad or okay 4th line, but what about defense only 3 I have heard up with a solid d man at 40yr old(Giordano) basically a waste of a possible playoff team....I may bite my words but even with a round 1 win they absolutely won't be able to win this cup..so since the islanders won me some money and I would love to see a eastern conference final NY Islanders vs NY Rangers...I'll keep betting on my friends from home's team most games are under dogs...win you silly team! As a rangers fan I remember 1994 atleast first 2 periods my dad woke me up screaming yes yes yes! I want my friends born in the early 80 mid 80s to see them hoist a cup for you islanders fans too! And I'm going to throw a future prediction ok so first one if Connor McDavid doesn't win a cup with the Oilers, some time in the future he signs with the rangers ( only if they don't end up winning a cup by then) another is if the rangers win a cup by the time mathews is a free agent he will definitely go to the rangers",2024-03-30 08:14:02,2024-03-30,hot

But I assure you that I am sincere, because I genuinely don't know the answer. Without a lot of unnecessary rambling: 'Can a penalty be committed against a teammate?'. 

It seems silly to even consider it. But I really don't know if a player could be called for tripping, or slashing a fellow teammate, for instance. 

I've searched and haven't found a definitive answer. Rule 60.2 specifically states that High Sticking applies if a stick makes contact with an opponent above the shoulders. But do all penalties have to be committed against an opponent?

I love Hockey and I watch it a lot. I'm pretty sure that I have never seen it happen if it can happen.
