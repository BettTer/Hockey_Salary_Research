In his OHL season, Barlow had an impressive record of 40 goals and 18 assists in 50 games. He is expected to gain AHL playoff experience with the Moose.
* Montreal Canadiens goaltender Cayden Primeau is scheduled to start against the New York Rangers. Primeau recently played against the Toronto Maple Leafs, where he successfully saved all 18 shots. This season, Primeau has played 20 games, has a record of 8-8-2, a .910 save percentage, and a 2.85 goals-against average.

5 Games for 5 Mediocre Teams to Get 2 Playoff Spots,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1byqhcn/5_games_for_5_mediocre_teams_to_get_2_playoff/,0,nhl,"With the Capitals OT loss today, the Metropolitan division has 3 teams on the outside of the playoffs with 83 points. The 3rd seed in the division is the Islanders at 85 points and the Red Wings are sneaking a chance at the wildcard with 84 points. How does the NHL get into this incredible situation?

Well, the Flyers and Capitals have lost 7 and 6 straight games, respectively, and the Islanders and Penguins have both won 4. All five teams (save the Flyers who have 4) have 5 games left. Most of them play at least one of the other teams in the race down this 5-game stretch. 

Meanwhile, the 2nd seed in the Metropolitan division right now? The Hurricanes with 105 points! There is a 20 point gap between 2nd and 3rd right now. 6 teams have clinched the playoffs in the east, the lowest of whom is the Lightning with 93 points, 8 points more than the Islanders. The wildcard race last year was around 90 points, the Penguins and the Sabres being the first on the outside with 91 points. This year, a team with 93 has already clinched. Most of these teams have to win 4 of 5 to crack 90. There WILL be a team that gets into the playoffs with under 90 points this year. I checked by hand and the most recent time that a team made the playoffs with less than 90 points was the Minnesota Wild in the 2015-16 season. In most seasons since (save COVID), the worst teams had on average mid-90s in terms of points. 

This is honestly nuts. It gets even stranger when you look at the remaining team's goal differentials. The Penguins (+5) and Red Wings (+3) are the only two not in the red. The Islanders, Flyers, and Capitals are well into the red at -23, -23, and -41, respectively. Most of these teams are saved by 10+ OT losses in terms of points (Islanders have 15), most of which were lost 5 seconds into OT if you're the Penguins. 

As an avid Penguins fan, I'd love to see us make it again after barely missing last year, but I really don't want any of these teams in the playoffs. One of two things will happen - 1) a team gets an insanely easy first round win, or 2) the top team in the league gets a pathetic upset again a la the 2019 Lightning or the 2023 Bruins. 

I doubt there's anything the NHL can do to prevent seasons like this, but how is this the season we've gotten? The Penguins were essentially eliminated a week ago and the east was basically set. I don't believe in conspiracy theories with sports, but the luck the Penguins have had in this last week and the collapse of the Caps and Flyers? Insane!",2024-04-08 05:58:44,2024-04-08,new

They should sit in the box between both penalties boxes, and only come out of it to get the puck and perform a faceoff, and breakup scrums and fights. I personally don‚Äôt like the on ice officials, because of experiences I have had with them getting in the way of the puck, players, and hits as well. (Think Sam Heideman in the ECHL) If there‚Äôs an offside, then they come out of the box and blow their whistle. Delayed penalty? Then they come out of the box to hold the their hand up to signal one. Immediate one? Blow their whistle as soon as they‚Äôre out of the box. Having them still be on the ice is almost entirely impractical in the day and age of microscopicly accurate cameras.",2024-04-07 17:08:06,2024-04-07,new

5 Games for 5 Mediocre Teams to Get 2 Playoff Spots,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1byqhcn/5_games_for_5_mediocre_teams_to_get_2_playoff/,0,nhl,"With the Capitals OT loss today, the Metropolitan division has 3 teams on the outside of the playoffs with 83 points. The 3rd seed in the division is the Islanders at 85 points and the Red Wings are sneaking a chance at the wildcard with 84 points. How does the NHL get into this incredible situation?

Well, the Flyers and Capitals have lost 7 and 6 straight games, respectively, and the Islanders and Penguins have both won 4. All five teams (save the Flyers who have 4) have 5 games left. Most of them play at least one of the other teams in the race down this 5-game stretch. 

Meanwhile, the 2nd seed in the Metropolitan division right now? The Hurricanes with 105 points! There is a 20 point gap between 2nd and 3rd right now. 6 teams have clinched the playoffs in the east, the lowest of whom is the Lightning with 93 points, 8 points more than the Islanders. The wildcard race last year was around 90 points, the Penguins and the Sabres being the first on the outside with 91 points. This year, a team with 93 has already clinched. Most of these teams have to win 4 of 5 to crack 90. There WILL be a team that gets into the playoffs with under 90 points this year. I checked by hand and the most recent time that a team made the playoffs with less than 90 points was the Minnesota Wild in the 2015-16 season. In most seasons since (save COVID), the worst teams had on average mid-90s in terms of points. 

This is honestly nuts. It gets even stranger when you look at the remaining team's goal differentials. The Penguins (+5) and Red Wings (+3) are the only two not in the red. The Islanders, Flyers, and Capitals are well into the red at -23, -23, and -41, respectively. Most of these teams are saved by 10+ OT losses in terms of points (Islanders have 15), most of which were lost 5 seconds into OT if you're the Penguins. 

As an avid Penguins fan, I'd love to see us make it again after barely missing last year, but I really don't want any of these teams in the playoffs. One of two things will happen - 1) a team gets an insanely easy first round win, or 2) the top team in the league gets a pathetic upset again a la the 2019 Lightning or the 2023 Bruins. 

I doubt there's anything the NHL can do to prevent seasons like this, but how is this the season we've gotten? The Penguins were essentially eliminated a week ago and the east was basically set. I don't believe in conspiracy theories with sports, but the luck the Penguins have had in this last week and the collapse of the Caps and Flyers? Insane!",2024-04-08 05:58:44,2024-04-08,hot
