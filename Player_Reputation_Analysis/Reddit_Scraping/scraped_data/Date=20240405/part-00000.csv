"Do you think whoever finishes 5th in Hart voting will have no 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th place votes on any individual ballot?",https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1bvvo9v/do_you_think_whoever_finishes_5th_in_hart_voting/,1,nhl,"No matter which order you have them in, Kucherov, MacKinnon, McDavid and Matthews are the consensus top 4 for the Hart to the point where they don’t list anyone else to bet on in most places. Whether you don’t think Matthews belongs with the top 3 or not, he’d still easily be the No. 4 guy for almost everyone.   

For voting for the award though, the writers have to list out their 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th place choices in order, with all individual ballots added up with a points system of 10-7-5-3-1. So if there are 200 individual ballots and say Panarin is 5th on all 200, he’d get 200 points. If a player is 1st on every ballot they would get 2,000 total points.     

Since the NHL went to a 1st-5th system in 1996, the highest finish for a player receiving nothing but 5th-place votes was Stamkos in 2022, when he was 11th place overall, receiving six 5th-place votes on the 195 total ballots.   

Given the clear separation of the top 4, as well as ballots being made public (which will let people see which writers elevated another player to knock down one of MacKinnon/McDavid/Kucherov/Matthews), do you think whoever finishes 5th this year will just be an accumulation of whoever gets the most 5th place votes, or do you think we’ll see someone outside of the big 4 receive votes between 1st-4th on a ballot as well?   

Usually I’d say there would be a few oddball votes, especially when you’re dealing with nearly 200 ballots, but with it being a particularly contentious year, if someone knocks one of the 4 down it could realistically cost that player the Hart just based on that one ballot, with voting likely being very tight in the top 3 in particular.",2024-04-04 19:05:27,2024-04-04,new

Season stats after January 1st, 2024: 1 goal, 9 assists, -4 rating in 45 games played

Not to mention that I know he's at least been on the PP unit for several games this season, and yet he has *zero* points on special teams. Zip. Zilch. Nada. The eye test has also been awful for him, and I feel as if Ilya's almost afraid to handle the puck at times whenever I see him in possession of the puck.

His $4.75M AAV contact is simply not worthwhile. And you can't really say that he's just getting back into it after the major injury he suffered previously, especially when he came out of the gates running this season. I'm not sure if it's lingering effects of his ACL injury or if something has gotten to his head somehow, but this man is simply not a good fit for the team anymore and he needs to go.

If the team elects to buyout Mikheyev, we save **$3.6M** of cap space right away next season, effectively negating the OEL cap penalty for next year (**$2.346M**) and then some. In 2025-26, we would then save **$2.6M** of cap space, which dampens the **$4.766M** cap penalty from OEL that year. This would then be followed by **$1.55M** of dead cap in both '26-27 and '27-28, which would respectively bring the total dead cap space in those years to **$6.316M** and **$3.676M**.

Logistically speaking, I think it makes more sense than a Dickinson-esque trade where we gambit another valuable draft pick and we can also bank on the salary cap to keep rising quite high throughout the remainder of the decade anyways thanks to factors such as the ESPN deal, so this wouldn't sting quite as bad in the later years.",2024-04-04 05:22:40,2024-04-04,new

On Toronto Second on the team in points is Nylander with 95 points 

On Tampa the second leading point scorer is Point with 83 points 

On the Rangers the second leading point scorer is Trocheck with 75 points 


Now with Ted Lindsay it should and will be McDavid, Kucherov and MacKinnon. They’re the 3 best players in the league this year and there is a difference between best and most valuable. I’m sure the Hart will also be those 3 guys and I have no issue with that because they’re all amazing and superstar players, all so damn exciting to watch but I think the Hart shouldn’t just go to the three top point scorers, it’s not always the top 3 every year anyway ",2024-04-04 03:55:32,2024-04-04,new

"Do you think whoever finishes 5th in Hart voting will have no 1st, 2nd, 3rd or 4th place votes on any individual ballot?",https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1bvvo9v/do_you_think_whoever_finishes_5th_in_hart_voting/,0,nhl,"No matter which order you have them in, Kucherov, MacKinnon, McDavid and Matthews are the consensus top 4 for the Hart to the point where they don’t list anyone else to bet on in most places. Whether you don’t think Matthews belongs with the top 3 or not, he’d still easily be the No. 4 guy for almost everyone.   

For voting for the award though, the writers have to list out their 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th place choices in order, with all individual ballots added up with a points system of 10-7-5-3-1. So if there are 200 individual ballots and say Panarin is 5th on all 200, he’d get 200 points. If a player is 1st on every ballot they would get 2,000 total points.     

Since the NHL went to a 1st-5th system in 1996, the highest finish for a player receiving nothing but 5th-place votes was Stamkos in 2022, when he was 11th place overall, receiving six 5th-place votes on the 195 total ballots.   

Given the clear separation of the top 4, as well as ballots being made public (which will let people see which writers elevated another player to knock down one of MacKinnon/McDavid/Kucherov/Matthews), do you think whoever finishes 5th this year will just be an accumulation of whoever gets the most 5th place votes, or do you think we’ll see someone outside of the big 4 receive votes between 1st-4th on a ballot as well?   

Usually I’d say there would be a few oddball votes, especially when you’re dealing with nearly 200 ballots, but with it being a particularly contentious year, if someone knocks one of the 4 down it could realistically cost that player the Hart just based on that one ballot, with voting likely being very tight in the top 3 in particular.",2024-04-04 19:05:27,2024-04-04,hot
