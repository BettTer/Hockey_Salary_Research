New Proposed Point Formatting... Thoughts?,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1btgbp7/new_proposed_point_formatting_thoughts/,0,nhl,"Hey everyone,

I was trying to kill some time today and thought about the current scoring format for the NHL standings and thought about a potential change (not that Bettman wants my opinion, lol). I even went as far as calculating standings (i.e., points) with these new totals. 

For calculating ties, any SOW or SOL was considered a tie, given that it was ""past OT"" and would be considered a tie in this new scoring format. I feel like this would be exciting and motivate players to really push for the RW and/or the OW. 

As you can see, the RWs really help some teams (i.e., Winnipeg and New Jersey) and not so much others (i.e., Boston).

Really interested in y'all's' thoughts!

Crosby is a top 5 all time player (IMO) but can anyone honestly say they enjoyed watching him play the game more than McDavid? Crosby is a tactical genius with elite talent in every facet of the game. He has the brain of a fighter pilot. 

 
McDavid is the jet. Watching him play the game on “easy mode” is more compelling than any hockey player in the post-lockout era. Maybe ever.

* The importance of free agent signings in the NHL has grown significantly since the introduction of the salary cap, with general managers seeing these acquisitions as a key opportunity to bolster their teams. Successful signings can transform a franchise into a contender or even a Stanley Cup winner, while poor decisions can lead to negative consequences, including job loss for the GM.
* The article assesses free agent signings from 2014 onward, evaluating the post-contract performance and team impact of the players involved. It highlights notable cases such as Sebastian Aho's offer sheet situation, the influence of Patrick Maroon's lower-profile signings, Alex Pietrangelo's successful move, Joe Pavelski's performance with Dallas, Zach Hyman's exceeding expectations with Edmonton, Sergei Bobrovsky's contentious but potentially redeeming contract with Florida, John Tavares's hometown return to Toronto, and Artemi Panarin's high-priced yet impactful signing with the New York Rangers.

Last night was my daughter's fifteenth birthday. On the way to the game, I asked her if she wanted to stop and make a poster and she said no it's ok. 
I could tell she just didn't want to cause a fuss but I assured her it was no problem. She agreed. Her sign simply says ""15th birthday, puck please"" 

We get to Amalie two hours early to be among the first in line to get in. Once inside, we rush directly to the warm up area and she puts her sign up on the glass. She is as happy as can be. She has been a lightning super fan for 10 years now. As have I. We don't miss a game together. 

She is having the time of her life. I am watching the warm up clock tick down. Stamkos tosses a puck to a little boy who lights up. Hagel dumps one over to a couple 20 something girls who go wild. Less than two minutes left and the boys start leaving the ice. I know it was a long shot to hope she would get a puck, but I was really hoping my beautiful, selfless, and growing up much to fast daughter, would luck out but maybe just not tonight.

Then Jonas.

He sees her sign, skates over, scoops a puck in his glove and sends it over. I grab it, frozen and covered in ice, and hand it to her, my heart racing. She cries. I cry, Jonas gives a smile so big you can see it through his mask, tilts his head and skates off. 

Jonas, you created a core memory for her. You made a girls birthday wish come true. You made an old dad immeasurably happy beyond words with your simple act of kindness. We are your biggest fans in the world. 

Vasy won the Lightning game last night. You won the game of life and our hearts.

The question I would have to ask is how is it ""better"" when you can theoretically have the something like the below occur, where the 3rd team in a division could be the 10th best team in the conference, but get grandfathered in. 

Not only would t hat snub (in this heavily fixed example) two teams, it also creates a scenario where the two ""best"" teams in the conference face each other in the 2nd round, (or in a bizarro world where this happens but the Caps still win), the Best team gets an even ""easier"" 2nd round game than the first round.

The issue with the old 3 division winners format was that we had bad teams get a free playoff spot solely  because of a bad division. Now we can get ""bad"" teams into the 2nd round solely because they're in a ""bad"" division.

The question I'd like to posit: how is that better than the previous alternative? How is ""Bad teams"" potentially getting to be in the 2nd round any better than ""bad teams"" getting to be one of the 8 playoff teams? (The example could be worse if I didn't start from the current standings, since it could in theory lead to both 2nd and 3rd in a division being worse than several teams from the other division, if results ended up being crazy enough)

The obvious counter argument is that this example has a very ""level playing field"" in the Met, since somehow 5 teams are within 4 points, but that'd probably serve as a better argument for a different format itself, since higher parity means less need to have guaranteed division spots?",2024-03-31 07:17:32,2024-03-31,new

Are BOTH National Anthems sung now regardless of who's playing?,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1bs35bx/are_both_national_anthems_sung_now_regardless_of/,0,nhl,"A little  in the weeds topic,  but I thought the only time both Anthems are sung, is when a team from Canada is playing a US team?  I am watching the New Jersey vs Buffalo game from    2 / 29 taking place in Buffalo, and they started off with the Canadian anthem.

It's funny because the Leafs played them tonight and it's colloquially known as Toronto's second home since so many do the trip down there.

I'll have to pay attention to games featuring both Canadian teams to see if they also sing the American anthem and if they do, it has to be a relatively recent thing.

Last night was my daughter's fifteenth birthday. On the way to the game, I asked her if she wanted to stop and make a poster and she said no it's ok. 
I could tell she just didn't want to cause a fuss but I assured her it was no problem. She agreed. Her sign simply says ""15th birthday, puck please"" 

We get to Amalie two hours early to be among the first in line to get in. Once inside, we rush directly to the warm up area and she puts her sign up on the glass. She is as happy as can be. She has been a lightning super fan for 10 years now. As have I. We don't miss a game together. 

She is having the time of her life. I am watching the warm up clock tick down. Stamkos tosses a puck to a little boy who lights up. Hagel dumps one over to a couple 20 something girls who go wild. Less than two minutes left and the boys start leaving the ice. I know it was a long shot to hope she would get a puck, but I was really hoping my beautiful, selfless, and growing up much to fast daughter, would luck out but maybe just not tonight.

Then Jonas.

He sees her sign, skates over, scoops a puck in his glove and sends it over. I grab it, frozen and covered in ice, and hand it to her, my heart racing. She cries. I cry, Jonas gives a smile so big you can see it through his mask, tilts his head and skates off. 

Jonas, you created a core memory for her. You made a girls birthday wish come true. You made an old dad immeasurably happy beyond words with your simple act of kindness. We are your biggest fans in the world. 

Vasy won the Lightning game last night. You won the game of life and our hearts.

Thank you Jonas Johansson #31. Thank you!

I was trying to kill some time today and thought about the current scoring format for the NHL standings and thought about a potential change (not that Bettman wants my opinion, lol). I even went as far as calculating standings (i.e., points) with these new totals. 

For calculating ties, any SOW or SOL was considered a tie, given that it was ""past OT"" and would be considered a tie in this new scoring format. I feel like this would be exciting and motivate players to really push for the RW and/or the OW. 

As you can see, the RWs really help some teams (i.e., Winnipeg and New Jersey) and not so much others (i.e., Boston).

Really interested in y'all's' thoughts!

**Regulation Win = 3 points; Overtime win = 2 points; Tie = 1 point**

**There would also be no points for losing in overtime...**

**e = eliminated; x = clinched playoff spot**

2) Carolina Hurricanes = 136 pts (x)

* The importance of free agent signings in the NHL has grown significantly since the introduction of the salary cap, with general managers seeing these acquisitions as a key opportunity to bolster their teams. Successful signings can transform a franchise into a contender or even a Stanley Cup winner, while poor decisions can lead to negative consequences, including job loss for the GM.
* The article assesses free agent signings from 2014 onward, evaluating the post-contract performance and team impact of the players involved. It highlights notable cases such as Sebastian Aho's offer sheet situation, the influence of Patrick Maroon's lower-profile signings, Alex Pietrangelo's successful move, Joe Pavelski's performance with Dallas, Zach Hyman's exceeding expectations with Edmonton, Sergei Bobrovsky's contentious but potentially redeeming contract with Florida, John Tavares's hometown return to Toronto, and Artemi Panarin's high-priced yet impactful signing with the New York Rangers.

What's funny is how hilariously bad the Sharks' records for those seasons were. 1992-93 especially would've made for one hell of a playoff appearance, finishing a respectable 61 points behind the actual 16th seed.

He noted how the groundwork for success had been laid in Boston, contrasting with the team in Anaheim where he and his teammates were working to establish a similar standard.
* The Bruins, having clinched a playoff spot after a remarkable regular season, face the challenge of preparing for the postseason with the aim of overcoming past disappointments. Despite not being considered the favorites, the team has the internal expectation of winning their first championship since 2011. Coach Jim Montgomery and captain Brad Marchand emphasize the importance of playing the right way and maintaining consistent preparation to ensure they are ready for the intense competition of the playoffs.

Theoretical (not happening this year) Problem with the Divisional Playoff Format,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1bs4ivn/theoretical_not_happening_this_year_problem_with/,0,nhl,"I find it surprising that despite all the people who complain about the playoff format, no one ever mentions the actual prospective problem of it. Whenever we talk about it, we run into the issue of the old 3 division format where the 3rd Division winner was utter trash but got a spot. The question I would have to ask is how is it ""better"" when you can theoretically have the something like the below occur, where the 3rd team in a division could be the 10th best team in the conference, but get grandfathered in. 

Not only would t hat snub (in this heavily fixed example) two teams, it also creates a scenario where the two ""best"" teams in the conference face each other in the 2nd round, (or in a bizarro world where this happens but the Caps still win), the Best team gets an even ""easier"" 2nd round game than the first round.

The issue with the old 3 division winners format was that we had bad teams get a free playoff spot solely  because of a bad division. Now we can get ""bad"" teams into the 2nd round solely because they're in a ""bad"" division.

The question I'd like to posit: how is that better than the previous alternative? How is ""Bad teams"" potentially getting to be in the 2nd round any better than ""bad teams"" getting to be one of the 8 playoff teams? (The example could be worse if I didn't start from the current standings, since it could in theory lead to both 2nd and 3rd in a division being worse than several teams from the other division, if results ended up being crazy enough)

The obvious counter argument is that this example has a very ""level playing field"" in the Met, since somehow 5 teams are within 4 points, but that'd probably serve as a better argument for a different format itself, since higher parity means less need to have guaranteed division spots?",2024-03-31 07:17:32,2024-03-31,hot
