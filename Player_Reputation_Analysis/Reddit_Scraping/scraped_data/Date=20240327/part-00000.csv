McDavid's case for the Hart trophy,https://i.redd.it/x0vfnn9sm0rc1.jpeg,0,nhl,"
First off, I'm fully aware of the predictable ""he never won it' bias that will populate the vote for the Hart, especially in the Colorado and Quebec media, the latter one looming large in the vote (Nate played in the Q). This is why I think it's time to start stating the case for McDavid as I believe, with plenty of arguments to support it, that McDavid should be the frontrunner IMHO. If you agree, please share this far and wide.



In order of importance 

1. The Oilers turnaround 

We are all familiar with the story. Despite McDavid and Draisaitl respectively getting 8 and 9 points in the first five games, the team was in complete disarray, bad defensive coverage, inefficient breakouts, getting otfen hemmed in the defensive zone. Nothing seemed to work other than the two juggernauts. After that, McDavid misses two games, two regulation losses, then comes back too quickly, following up with 2 points in 6 games until Woodcroft gets fired and Knoblauch gets hired. The team is 3-9-1 at that point. Knoblauch wins his two first games, loses the next three and McDavid has 6 points in 5 games. The team is 5-12-1 at that point, with McDavid getting a concerning and irregular 16 points in 16 games. 

Then the turnaround happens. 8 wins in a row, then 3 losses, then the great sequence of 16 wins. Since the 16 wins, they've leveled off a bit, playing around .650, with a 14-8-3 record. 

In total, they've been 38-11-3 in the last 52 games, topping the league with 79 points in that sequence (a 125/82 pace), a +27 win differential. 2nd closest was Carolina with 75 in 55, a +20 win differential. To put that into perspective, a team needs +18 in 82 games to get to 100 points. 

In that span, Edmonton led the league in GF/G, was 4th in GA/G, but most importantly, they've had the best +/- differential per game. 

A look at individual results on the team in that span is very revealing: 

McDavid
52gp 20g 83a 103pts
+38 74 primary points 70 ESP 

Draisaitl
52gp 32g 38a 70pts
+26 53 PRP 43 ESP 

Bouchard
52gp 11g 43a 54pts
+34 25 PRP 30 ESP 

Hyman
51gp 41g 12a 53pts
+32 49 PRP 39 ESP 

Nugent-Hopkins
52gp 14g 33a 47pts
+11 32 PRP 26 ESP 

Outscoring Draisaitl by 33 points in 52 games is one thing, but getting as many even-strenght points than Draisaitl had in total points is even more incredible. 

This alone IMO, that sequence since November 24th, makes McDavid the frontrunner. The Hart is supposed to be exactly about this type of accomplishment, literally carrying a team. McDavid participated in 52.3% of Edmonton's goals scored in those 52 games. Unfortunately, this kind of context is foreign to many who rather just look at raw totals, which brings me to number 2 on the list.



2. 50 primary assists in 49 games 

Before I go into this, I have to say I'm still in complete disbelief nobody caught this. Neither the NHL, Edmonton sports media or any other affiliated media has talked about this. No one seemed to notice and yet it's a very rare accomplishment. Primary assists can often be more important than the goal itself. I consider this feat just as amazing as 50/50 goals and its rarity proves that. 

Most would state McDavid's quite probable incoming 100 assists as the second reason, but this feat IMO should overshadow it. From the day the Oilers turnaround started on November 24th, up to last week, on March 21st, Connor had 50 primary assists in 49 games. A 50/50 for primary assists had happened only 11 times before, by only two players. Wayne & Mario. 99 had 9, while 66 did it twice. Last time was Mario Le Magnifique in 1991-1992, more than 30 years ago. The Great One's record for best 50/50 stands at 52 primary assists in 29 games, which he did from December 11th 1985 to Valentine's day in 1986. Mario did it in 47 and 48 games respectively. The closest after Wayne, Mario and now Connor, was Elmer Lach in the famous WW2 league-depleted season of 1944-1945 where his linemate, the Rocket, had the very first 50 goals in 50 games. That season, Lach had 47 primary assists in 50 games. Closest after that is Lafontaine with 44 in 50. After that, it dwindles out with only a few players going around 40 in 50.



3. 71 primary assists 

In the history of the league, only one player has ever had higher than 70 primary assists in a season. Who else than Wayne? In fact, he's the only player to actually finish higher than 1 primary assist per game for a complete season. His record stands at a whopping 112 primary assists. Two players stand at 70. Mario with 70 in 73 games and Joe Thornton with 70 in 81 games. 

Right now, Connor is at 58 on the season and considering he's had 27 of them in his last 22 games, it's feasible that he can end the season with 13 in 12 games, bringing him second only to Wayne.



4. 100++ assists. 

We're all more familiar with this one. Another select group. McDavid might even reach 110 when it's all said and done. He's more than likely to eclipse Bobby Orr and come close to Mario's best season at 114.



5. Back-to-back 60+ primary assists 

60 primary assists or more happened 27 times, by 14 players. Only one player had a back-to-back. In fact, Gretzky had a whopping 11 in a row and an equal 11 in career total. McDavid needs only 2 primary assists in the last 12 games to become the second player to do it. He will also tie Denis Savard with two total. Mario is second to Wayne with 3 seasons of 60+ primary assists.



6. 90 to 95 Even-strenght points 

Johnny Gaudreau had quite a season a few years back, notching 90 even-strenght points. It was the highest finish since Jagr had 95 in 1995-1996. Second to Gaudreau since Jagr is McDavid last year with 84. Right now, Mack has 80, Kuch 79 and McDavid has 78, but the latter had 70 of those 78 in the last 52 games. Out of the three, McDavid is the most likely to pass 90. He needs 17 in his last 12 to catch Jagr, just a notch over his average in the last 52 games.



7. Carrying Hyman 

Now, don't knee-jerk. Hyman's accomplishment is great no matter what, but let's get real here. There are maybe 2 other players in the league who 'might' push Hyman to 50 goals. It's hypothetical. Still, Connor assisted 33 of Hyman's 51 goals so far. 23 of them were primary assists. To contrast this, we often hear how Bobby Orr carried Bucyk to 51 goals by assisting 25 of them.



8. The Art Ross race 

IMO, it would be completely unfair to McDavid to punish him for playing injured early on. Compare McDavid's rates in the last 52 games to Mack and Kuch's entire seasons and a different picture emerges than the tight race we're witnessing right now. It explains why McDavid has made-up so much ground, despite both players having career seasons. 

Pts/Gp
McDavid 1.98
Kucherov 1.75
Mackinnon 1.71 

Primary Pts/Gp
McDavid 1.42
Kucherov 1.28
Mackinnon 1.19 

ESP/Gp
McDavid 1.35
Mackinnon 1.11
Kucherov 1.11 

P/Gp gap with 2nd best teammate
McDavid vs Draisaitl +0.63
Kucherov vs Point +0.61
Mackinnon vs Rantanen +0.36 

Also interesting to note, McDavid's average TOI is 21:29 in those 52 games, which is less than either Kuch or Mack, whether over the entire season or Connor's last 52 games, which means McDavid distanced them even more in terms of per60. 

McDavid's team leading +36 in the last 52 games and all those other stats is the main reason why the Oilers have dominated the league in that span. To me, it's simply a much bigger story than whatever people want to cook-up for Mack or Kuch, but naturally, people will gloss over season totals and proclaim voter fatigue.",2024-03-28 06:03:12,2024-03-28,new

Only ONE point separates Vancouver in first from Boston in seventh. If the NHL were more culturally similar to European soccer, where finishing first in the league is a hugely prestigious achievement, then the next few weeks would be one of the most electric “title races” of all time. But in reality, even though there is technically a trophy on the line, no one really cares about it including the teams themselves. Some fans genuinely root for their team NOT to win it to avoid bad luck.

The home stretch of the season could be so much more exciting than nervously waiting for the playoffs to start. Of course there’s still the jockeying for playoff seeding, but it doesn’t feel that meaningful when we all know unexpected teams catch fire every spring. I think North American sports fans have an “all-or-nothing” mentality where only pursuing the playoff championship matters whatsoever, as opposed to Europe where there’s this concept of multiple trophies of varying prestige. Obviously the Stanley Cup should still be king, but the end of the season could be a thrilling lead-in to the main event of the playoffs if the hockey community ascribed SOME importance to the President’s Trophy.

Edit - a lot of people are talking about needing to add some kind of reward like a draft pick to make it relevant. I’m saying it should be relevant in and of itself. Why does winning the Cup matter? Because it just does. Same should go for the Pres Trophy but to a lesser extent.",2024-03-26 00:14:11,2024-03-26,new

Went to 7 games against St. Louis in round two but man, if we just had a halfway decent defense that year we could have went all the way.

Bossy- amongst players with at least 200 goals, Bossy is the all time leader at goals per game with 0.76. Unfortunately, his career got cut short abruptly with his back. His last year was the only year he didn’t score at least 50 goals and he still scored 38 that year.

Lemieux- Mario is second at goals per game at 0.75 and that’s only because of his second run. At the conclusion of ‘97, he was at 0.82. He lost a lot of time because of injury and illness. A healthy Lemieux is probably pushing 1000 goals.

Gretzky- he’s at 0.60 like Ovechkin. Wayne’s goal scoring pace dipped once he got to LA but his scoring in Edmonton was unreal.


Another to watch for is Auston Matthews. He’s at 0.65 right now. We’ll see how his career pans. Hopefully he’s blessed with longevity. ",2024-03-24 19:29:39,2024-03-24,new

Why does a camera exist that is SPECIFICALLY for offside reviews that does not constantly run in slow motion? Being to see even one frame between these two images would be enough to conclusively say this was offside.

I am, very generally speaking, annoyed by the offside reviews in general and how long some of them take.

Pulling your goalie on a powerplay? Maybe if....?,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1bkr0vz/pulling_your_goalie_on_a_powerplay_maybe_if/,0,nhl,"Coaches are pulling goalies more often earlier than ever before. If I understand correctly, analytics say it's worth it to try anything to at least get a point forcing an overtime, as well as a loss is a loss. There is no standings penalty for how many goals you lose by. Why does that reasoning never carry over to a losing team pulling a goalie on a powerplay, in situations where statistics say the team will most likely lose anyway? Example would be maybe down by 3 goals in the third, especially vs. teams that rarely lose when ahead by X goals. Here are my reasons to think it could be a valid strategy. First, I think a 6 on 4 is highly unlikely to give up an empty netter by anything other than a lucky shot from the defensive zone. I can't see six skaters allowing the team of 4 advancing anywhere past the neutral zone. The 6 on 4 also allows the attacking team an extra man to clear out and own the slot in front of the crease. If I remember correctly, stats year to year show the team leading by x amount of goals heading into the third, wins the game 80%-90% of the time.

The hearing stems from a Wilson high-stick on the Toronto Maple Leafs' Noah Gregor during the third period of a Washington loss on Wednesday. He received a double minor penalty for swinging his stick and hitting Gregor in the face.

Wilson was offered the in-person hearing earlier Thursday, indicating a potential suspension of six games or more for the repeat offender.""

Am I the only one that wants to do away with most offside challenges?,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1bkfkgu/am_i_the_only_one_that_wants_to_do_away_with_most/,0,nhl,"The fundamental purpose of offsides is, and always has been to avoid one team gaining an advantage by either camping in the offensive zone  and cherry picking goals, or otherwise having a teammate zoom ahead of the play to try and take a break away pass behind the defence. That still happens to some extent, but it's limited to passes just on-side of the blue line, which still gives the defence some time to catch the player. Even then, we don't see an abundance of players camping at the blue line, because that takes them out of the play and gives the other team an effective power play in your zone. 

With the replay rules as they are, what we are seeing is that if there was an offsides at any point before a goal, the goal will be wiped out and the clock reset *unless* the zone was cleared after the offsides. So there could be 30 seconds of cycling in the O-zone after an offside all for nothing.

Also for all practical purposes, any offside that is subject to replay is going to be a matter of inches. linesmen don't miss players 10 feet into the zone. Those are going to be called. Replay catches offsides that are so close that the linesman couldn't tell. That is not likely to be a system that teams would have any way to intentionally exploit of the rule was changed.

In my opinion, ""unless the zone is cleared"" is too long a window. In my view, if the puck is brought in offsides, and that team scores directly on the initial rush into the zone, that should be repayable, because an offside could have had a usually (marginal) effect on the defence and the goal being scored.

But once the initial rush is over, maybe once 5 seconds have passed or once the defensive team has possessed the puck and there's been a turnover back to the offensive team, or once there have been 5 passes or some other metric - once that initial rush is over, the offside has no bearing on the play - the defence has had a chance to reset and there's no unfair advantage anymore where we need to call a goal back because of an extremely close offside 30 seconds earlier.

It sucks a bunch of energy out of the game and the arena, and takes a bunch of time. Even as a fan of the team who wins the challenge, I don't get a rush of excitement when a call goes our way in those circumstances.

Similarly, a missed hand pass or puck touched by a high stick - unless those plays lead *directly* to a goal - like the goal is scored within 2 passes, it doesn't seem like the kind of thing we need to go back 40 seconds and call, and replay 40 seconds of game.

In a game where lots of penalties are subjective and ""missed"" in fan eyes all the time, and even things like icing are subjective and ""missed"" at times, it doesn't seem like the problem that needs fixing are simple stoppages for trivial infractions like a hand pass or touched by high stick that don't directly cause a goal. I've literally never seen a fan get up in arms at a hand pass that wasn't called. Hand on puck or puck gloved into the net? Sure. But not a hand pass or a touched by high stick.

During Lebron James’ stay here, all we ever heard was when Lebron planned on leaving Cleveland for a more glamorous market. Obviously, it happened twice, the second time, not as bad as the first. On the flip side, why wasn’t there ever much national debate about if/when Crosby was going to leave Pittsburgh? The two cities are relatively similar in size and are not Chicago, New York, Miami, LA esque hotbeds for nightlife and exposure. I’ve just been baffled by how the greatest basketball player of his era was constantly getting berated with that question, and the greatest hockey player of his era either seldom was or never was pressured to go somewhere more glamorous than Pittsburgh. If you think about it, they’ve been in their professional leagues for close to the same amount of time.

Hypothetical: NHL Lockout,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1bjwmv2/hypothetical_nhl_lockout/,0,nhl,"So as most know in 2004-05 the NHL had a lockout and did not compete for the Stanley Cup, given that the Stanley Cup does not belong to the NHL the board of trustees elected to not allow for other contenders, and in 2012 I believe they made a ruling that pretty much says that the Stanley Cup does not belong to the NHL, but the NHL is the only league that's allowed to compete for it. 

My question is, if the next lockout the trustees decided that they would let another league/leagues compete for it who would? I'd assume the AHL and ECHL would be out since they are minor leagues of the NHL so their contracts are probably with the NHLPA too (unless I'm wrong), and it couldn't be a league like Liiga since it's not in North America.

Secondly, would you guys support this or feel like it is a stain on the cup to possibly have some beer league on it. Personally, I would be all for it, thinking that years from now someone could be researching Stanley Cup champions, watching some video on Youtube, and come across this anomaly. Similar to how we see teams like the Montreal Maroons, Portland Rosebuds, or Seattle Metropolitans.

 there’s absolutely some recency bias in here, which I think is fair. The game is growing and improving, and players are constantly getting more skilled. That’s not to say all history should be overlooked though.

Ovechkin feels like a stretch to me, but it’s hard to have a top 10 without the leading goal scorer of all time on it (yes, i’m assuming things).

But thats when the internet came. And basically, I came across basically a ranking of all the 31 NHL teams at the time. 
And that's when I was interested as a kid. The logos of the NHL teams were really cool.
The one that started it was the Arizona Coyotes (the one before the 2021 change). I know, looking back I know that most people don't like that logo, but hey! I thought a coyote howling was cool. I looked it up a bit more, found out what NHL was, starting researching the basic rules of hockey.
But then, the team that really got me into it was the San Jose Sharks. Wow, little me thought that was the most coolest thing ever. I lived in Northern California at the time too, so i LOVED the San Jose Sharks when I was little. They were the first ever sports and hockey game I went to (funny enough the game was San Jose Sharks VS Arizonia Coyotes). I didn't even know the basics of sports like Goalies, Defense, all that! I just loved the experience, and that goal horn too!! I remember drawing the logo a bunch when I was younger. 
I stopped getting into hockey for a while until recently when I moved close to a hockey arena, now with all my knowledge I know about the NHL, I couldn't help but look back and see how funny this all really was.

Montreal Canadiens - The most glorious and historical team ever in hockey! 💙⚜️💙,https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/montreal-canadiens,0,nhl,"The Montreal Canadiens are the oldest professional hockey team in the world and one of the most storied franchises in professional sports. Founded in 1909 and officially called the Club de Hockey Canadien, the team (also known as the Les Habitants, or Habs for short) is the only existing National Hockey League (NHL) franchise to have formed prior to the league’s inception in 1917.

In 1917, the Canadiens took to the ice in new uniforms with a new crest — a stylized C with an H in the middle. The letters in the crest symbolized the team’s new official name, the Club de Hockey Canadien. The H in the logo stands for hockey, not habitant, as many believe. This misconception apparently originated with Madison Square Garden owner Tex Rickard, who mistakenly told a reporter in 1924 that the H stood for habitant. The word — the name for land-owning settlers of New France — was by then a common nickname for the team. The first known reference to the Canadiens as the “Habitants” was in Le Devoir on 9 February 1914, in the description of a game against a team from Toronto. (“Sans contredit les ‘Habitants’ eurent l’avantage continuellement.”/ “Without a doubt, the ‘Habitants’ constantly had the edge.”) The term’s association with the club is believed to stem from the fact that the team was marketed as the city’s French hockey club, as opposed to the English team, the Montreal Wanderers. In those early years, many Canadiens fans would even show their affiliation with the club by attending games in traditional habitant attire such as tuques, moccasins and brightly colored sashes.

More recently, however, the term habitant has fallen out of favour with French Canadians, who see it as a derogatory word generally meaning “uncouth peasant.” As Mark Abley has explained, “In contemporary French, if you have ‘habitant manners’ you’re a country bumpkin. If you want to disparage the traditional folksongs of the province, call them ‘habitant music.’ As they turned their backs on the Roman Catholic church and the agricultural past, Quebecers rejected many of the symbols they had once held dear — habitants among them.” (See Habitants and French-Speaking Quebec.) Abley has also explained that the shortened version of the term, habs, “does not suffer from the negative associations of ‘habitant’.",2024-03-18 20:47:08,2024-03-18,new

Long time back when I was deciding on team it was between the canadiens and islanders.
My first trip to visit my family in Canada I was luckily enough to go to my first nhl game which was the canadiens, while later on going to new York and watching the islanders, who as a Millwall fc supporter here in England was drawn to the little guy in new York.
I ended up as a Habs fan as they won the stanley cup year I was born.

Why is Kucherov not the Hart favorite?,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1bhvy56/why_is_kucherov_not_the_hart_favorite/,0,nhl,"as of 3/18/24 the stats for the major finalists are:

Mackinnon: 68 gp 42g 74a 116p

Kucherov: 66 gp 40g 74a 114p

McDavid: 63 gp 25g 81a 106p

Matthews: 65 gp 55g 27a 82p

My interpretation of the Hart trophy is the player that is the most valuable to their team’s success. We saw a precedent set when Taylor Hall won the Hart over Mackinnon in 2017-18, which was rationalized by Hall carrying the devils to the playoffs, having 41 points more than the second highest scoring player on his team. The Hart is also typically given to historical seasons, which would likely be given to Matthews if he reaches 70 goals (on pace for 69 in 82gp) or McDavid with 100 assists (on pace for 105 in 82gp)

Nikita Kucherov trails Mackinnon by 2 points for most points in the league, but has played 2 less games. He is dragging the Lightning into the 1st WC spot in the east, in a year where he has 41 points more than the second scorer on his team (Point with 73). We have literally seen this exact situation before. 

Mackinnon is the current favorite. He has the help of Rantanen (6th in points with 90) and Makar (T17th in points with 74). The Avalanche aren’t president trophy locks or in trouble of missing the playoffs. It seems like people really want to give him an MVP. He’s a great player and injuries have limited him from previous MVP campaigns. As much as this year seems to be “his year,” it really should not be unless he has a finish that seperates him from the pack. 

I don’t understand why Kucherov is not the favorite. Despite people wanting Mackinnon to receive his rightful MVP and spiting Kucherov for all star weekend, there isn’t a valid argument to be made against Kucherov in my opinion.

I’ve been a Leaf fan since I was a wee lad cheering on Clark, Gilmour, Potvin and company. It’s been a turbulent ride and I’ve endured all the regular season AND playoff collapses but my issue is not with the players or management. It’s the fans.

We have the worst fan base in the NHL. We go way beyond criticism to the point of outright vilification. This narrative has been building and I think it has some traction. Maybe, since we are so hard on the players and even run some of them out of town, WE are to blame for some of their shortcomings. 

Imagine being out on the ice knowing what treatment you’ll receive if you give the puck away or miss an empty net. Maybe we are causing them to grip their sticks a little tighter. I understand they are professional hockey players being paid millions of dollars, but they are human. 

I doubt this is received well but sometimes it’s not easy being part of this toxic fan base. Be critical, it’s your right as a fan, but do we have to get to the point where players actually don’t want to play here because of us? Is it possible we are actually part of the problem that has lead to numerous playoff failures?

I don’t know the answer but I know being a mean, toxic fan can’t help. ",2024-03-18 13:37:44,2024-03-18,new

GOAT Debate /// ***Spoiler Alert*** It's not Wayne and won't be McDavid,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1bgdza9/goat_debate_spoiler_alert_its_not_wayne_and_wont/,0,nhl,"Can we all agree that Sidney Crosby is the greatest hockey player of all time? I think if we accept realistic facts instead of harboring these notions that they each did what they did when they did it, we can all agree that obviously we are in the most competitive era of hockey. Skills are higher, players are bigger, pressure is greater, money is more. Everything about the game has surpassed beyond crediting guys like Orr, Gretzky, Lemuix, Hull, Howe.....etc....other than giving them the credit that they were the greatest of the pioneers for the game. Yes, Wayne is the 'nostalgic GOAT' but what Sid has done since Day 1 in this era should make him the clear vote for greatest. Scoring is harder, plays are more complex, lanes are smaller. Everything about the game has inflated, why are we hanging on to a legacy set in a generation prior.

I will also say that I don't think even McDavid will surpass Crosby. Sadly, even as a die-hard Oilers fan, I think that having gone this long without winning 1 or more SC's has prevented him from ever surpassing Sid, unless he wins 4-5 cups from now forward.

Everything fell in to it's perfect spot for Sidney. The timing was perfect for everything he accomplished and he was fortunate to be able to not only play in the Olympics but also win a Gold but also GET THE GAME WINNING GOLD MEDAL GOAL.

I know McDavid is on another level, but I still feel that on a general scale Sidney Crosby is the greatest to every play the game.

Top Goal Scorers Under 30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1bfbm2t/top_goal_scorers_under_30/,5,nhl,"I was looking through the top goal scorers under 30 and saw some surprising results in goals per game. Only requirement was at least 150 (Kaprizov has 148) goals scored in their career so far. 

1. Austin Matthews - .650 G/GP

2. Kirill Kaprizov - .563 G/GP

3. Connor McDavid - .520 G/GP

4. David Pastrnak - .518 G/GP

5. Leon Draisaitl - .483 G/GP

6. Kyle Connor -  .458 G/GP

7. Mikko Rantanen - .456 G/GP

8. Brayden Point - .450 G/GP

9. Jake Guentzel - .434 G/GP

10. Patrick Laine - .425 G/GP


A couple things I found interesting were how elite of a goal scorer Kaprizov is. I knew he was among the leagues best, but he’s been consistently good at scoring goals since going the league. He is on pace for his third straight 40 goal season. Had he played a full season his rookie year he would likely have 4 straight 40 goal seasons to start his NHL career. 

 Patrick Laine at #10 is strange to see. He lot the league up early in his career, but has been plagued with injuries ever since. Also, he’s only 25. If he can find some health he could really start putting some numbers up. 

It’s crazy seeing just how elite Matthews is. He’s a full point ahead of Kaprizov.  He ranks 5th all time for G/GP. If he can play a long career we could see him climb high up the all time goals list. I think it’s safe to say he will be the number one goals scored for an American by the time his career is over.

With the recent rash of fights in the league courtesy of Rempe, I went down the rabbit hole of those the game had lost due to suicides from head injuries stemming from fighting because that was their role in the game.   

Really sad it is the only way some guys can stay in the game.   Beyond the fighting aspect, there is other plays that can lead to this as well, namely cheap shots to the head.   What can the game do to improve upon this? Are the measures in place to penalize players who target the head enough?   More can always be done by it feels like the rules are being mocked and players are still doing it with little repercussions when DoPS actually does anything about it.  

Would like to encourage a healthy discussion on the topic but I think it needs a deep forensic analysis on this aspect of the game we all love and enjoy, but the human toll just isn't being addressed enough.  ",2024-03-14 09:48:59,2024-03-14,new

And there are definitely a lot of things wrong with how hockey is played in the NHL relative to the ECHL. 

* First of all, the ECHL plays on a smaller rink surface, leading to more chaos during the games
* More physicality, a biproduct of the smaller surface. there are often scrums after every time the goalie freezes the puck, and much more fighting.
* All of our teams use Rock and Roll Part 2 by Gary Glitter as a goal song. The royalties don't go to his bank account anymore because he is a fugitive on the run, so its ethical to use (Bring back the ""Hey, You Suck!"" chant in the NHL. As an Everblades fan, that is one of, if not my favorite part of the goal song/ horn combo)
* Tickets are way too fucking expensive, I get that everyone from the Jets fan's to the Toronto City Zoo bitch about standing room ticket purchases requiring the house to be refinanced, but $50 each for nosebleeds? Seriously?
* More fan interaction: I get that it's easier to do this in a 7,500 person ECHL rink, and not so much an NHL rink, but is it that hard to have like 3 people in mascot suits running around the lower and upper bowls? (Not at the same time, likely staggered)
* Bring the elevation of the upper bowl down, no one in the nose bleeds has a shot at getting a puck that went out of play.
* More. Cowbells.
* End the whole streaming shit, it's dumb. Just do a FloHockey thing where you charge an extremely high amount of money upfront for an entire seasons worth of coverage of the entire league. The NHL would probably make more money doing this, as there isn't a bunch of money grubbing execs trying to take ad revenue from the NHL
* Merge the NHL and AHL into a super league, and doe something like MLB, where you have the National League, and American League. ECHL then becomes a little more crowded, which then requires a fourth single A affiliate league. (NFL and MLB do American Vs. National, why can't we?)
* Not really an ECHL thing, but do 10 minutes of 3 on 3 OT, without sudden death. 
* Put NHL teams in places that already have NBA teams (Stadiums literally just sitting there, waiting for an iceplant and a goal horn to be installed.",2024-03-13 05:25:52,2024-03-13,new

With that, I thought I'd come to reddit and get some feedback on what very well may be my submission to what they team would be if we actually get one back.

I've gotten some names and concepts down, such as the Atlanta Inferno, Peach State Incinerators (you can sub the two location names for each other), etc. Some names I've thought of don't have staying power and some i cant use because other teams use something similar or an exact name that could potentially cause legal issues, so while the drawing/design phase hasn't happened yet, I'm still getting stumped at times.

As of now, I have maybe 2-3 ideas for logos and they could all very well be shoulder patch alts or secondary logos. First, for the Atlanta Inferno/Incinerators, a flaming A on top of a shield. This logo would be paying homage to both our former teams. Secondly, the Peach State version of those names would have a heart-shaped peach on fire, maybe with the flames forming a leaf. And lastly, a torch representing an I that could be used for Atlanta and/or Peach State; Maybe the flame of the torch could be either an A or PS for the initials of whatever the team uses.

Really all I want to know is what you guys think a team could be named or look like if we got one back. I live making fictional team concepts and hope this could benefit me in making a career outta designing for sports teams/leagues.",2024-03-13 03:14:10,2024-03-13,new

There was a security issue upstairs so everyone in the Southwest terminal had to be dropped off and wait downstairs at baggage claim until it was resolved (suspicious bag). Even though it was early (0530) there were still a lot of people starting to pile up inside. 

When we were finally released to go, I was in line to get to the elevator and coming in through the doors I saw a guy with a baggage trolley loaded down with 3 hockey bags and a bundle of goalie sticks (like at least 7). I saw the bags said Americans so I asked “is that the Rochester Americans?” And he said yeah that he had just gotten traded from Buffalo to San Jose. 

I LOVE hockey. I have absolutely made it atleast 3/4 of my personality by now. But I still don’t know every player on every team in the NHL and AHL. I didn’t have a clue who he was but I asked him if he was excited to get away from the cold. He said he was happy to be traded because he’s from San Jose and I exchanged words with him about how I was happy he would be across so many time zones because as someone who’s in the military I know how hard it is to have a large time distance for communication purposes. 
I helped him upstairs and to get to the line he needed to be in because he was an A-list member. He was super sweet and didn’t seem to mind my early morning chattering (I have ADHD and Adderall really gets me going). 

Devin Cooley is a really sweet guy and super stoked to be playing for the team he’s loved since he was a kid. In STL we love our hometown boys so I hope you San Jose fans show him lots of love when he comes up to play his first game with yall. 

So so long but it was my first( and only) player interaction but I thought if there’s anyone that would appreciate my story, it would be people in this group.

Here are my questions…

1. Do teams US teams need work visa to enter/play Canadian teams? Furthermore are US players taxes a portion of their salaries considering they are “working” 

2. How do teams deal with their international players? Are they all on extended work visas of some sort or do a lot of players apply for citizenship? Is money still owed to their native countries? 

3. Not sure if this is still a thing but as the AHL systems has shifted around since i last checked but I remember back in the day Ottawa & Vancouver had their AHL affiliates in NY. To me it sounds like a big hassle to call up players for all the same reasons mentioned above.

**Ive seen the light, McDavid sucks because he hasn’t won a cup. Clearly when I posted it, I implied that no one cares about the Cup at all, so that was cool that you all picked up on it. Ridiculous. Is it all sensitive Penguins fans? Or do people actually think McDavid sucks because his teams have been garbage? I don’t get it.**",2024-03-10 18:30:44,2024-03-10,new

Bedard has the 2nd worst +/- through a forward’s first 50 games in NHL history and the worst in the last 49 years,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1bb05pv/bedard_has_the_2nd_worst_through_a_forwards_first/,0,nhl,"50 games into his career, Bedard is -37, which ties him for 2nd worst in NHL history (stat started being tracked in the 1959/60 season) with 1972/73 Dave Hudson, who played for the 12-60-8 Islanders in their expansion season.   

The worst is Mike Marson, who was -40 after his first 50 games with the Capitals in their 1974/75 expansion season, where they went 8-67-5. Marson was actually +3 over his 51st and 52nd games, so Bedard will likely be the worst ever over the next couple games if he gets at least -1.    

There are 9 defensemen who have had a worse +/- than Bedard’s -37 through 50 games, the worst being 1974/75 Greg Joly, who was -71 for those same Capitals through 1974/75 and 1975/76.    

The most recent D-man with a worse +/- than Bedard is Pat MacLeod at -50 (2nd worst through first 50 games behind Joly). His first 50 games played came with the 1990/91 North Stars, and 91/92-92/93 Sharks. He only played 53 total games in his career and was an IHL/SHL/ECHL player otherwise.   

**Bedard compared to post-lockout players**    

The only forwards to be -25 or worse in their first 50 career games post-2004/05 lockout are:   

1. Connor Bedard: -37 (2023/24 Blackhawks)      
2. Enver Lisin: -31 (06/07-08/09 Coyotes)   
3. Alex Wennberg: -29 (14/15 Blue Jackets)   
4. Yegor Chinakov: -25 (21/22 Blue Jackets)   

The worst totals (-25 or worse) for defensemen post-lockout are:   

1. Isaak Phillips: -35 (21/22-23/24 Blackhawks)   
2. Taylor Chorney: -28 (08/09-10/11 Oilers)   
3. Jackson LaCombe: -26 (22/23-23/24 Ducks)   
4. Rasmus Ristolainen: -26 (13/14-14/15 Sabres)   

**Worst 50-game stretches for any player since the lockout**   

Since the 2004/05 lockout, the only forward to have a worse 50-game stretch in a season than Bedard is Andreas Athanasiou, who was -45 in a 50-game stretch for the Wings in 2019/20.   

The only defenseman with a worse 50-game stretch since the lockout than Bedard is Nick Leddy at -44 for the 2017/18 Islanders.",2024-03-10 03:13:05,2024-03-10,new

All I want is just a humble discussion about everyone favorite players, it can be all time favorites, or even favorites of this season. I'll start!

My favorite player of all time is Dion Phaneuf. I grew up watching Toronto all the time, and he was always my favorite player. As he was a really good player nice all arounder, great skating, physical with a hard shot and not to mention an awesome Captain. Even though I wasn't watching Hockey at the time he was traded it still made me really sad to hear it. And in my opinion is one of Toronto's worst trade decisions. He was my childhood hero, and I was saddened not to see his retirement.

As for my favorite player currently, I'd say Mark Scheifele or Adam Lowry as I'm a Winnipeg guy and they remind me a lot of Dion. In that both of Scheifele and Lowry are amazing all around, and Lowry really knows how to get the team going! Like when Winnipeg is down in a game, he tries his damnest to get them going which I love in a Captain.

This is just to fully make fun of the dumbass fans bitching about the LTIR. Tampa brought it up in 2015, wasnt changed. Sportsnet said in 2022 Gms arent eagar to change it. Guess why? THE NHL DOESNT HAVE AN ISSUE WITH IT ONLY FANS DO (i personally really dont care)

If a player wants to spent thousands and thousands of dollars and a lot of their time to become a NHL player and then continue to put in that effort to have an NHL job. Theres a real good chance when they go to LTIR they are hurt   


**2022 Avs**

Oh whats that MacKinnon on played 65 regular season games, but wait he played 20 playoff games. Oh now Landeskog played 51 games that season yet also played 20 playoff games. You mean the both Mack and Landeskog could have been on the LTIR the year they won the cup  


**2020 Tampa (we were around for 2021)**

Gee golly. Stamkos played 57, Point and Hedman both played 66 games and Kucherov played 68 games.  Yet Point had 23 playoff games, Kucherov, Hedman had 25 playoff games. Stamkos legit missed playoffs he played 1 game, but he scored  


**2019 Blues**

ROR and Tarasenko were healthy but whats this Perron only played 57 games then scored 16 points in 26 playoff games oh how dare he missed 20+ regular season games, oh now Pietrangelo only played 71 regular season games too, yet played 26 playoff games. Well the Blues must have also cheated. Pietrangelo and Perron didnt play a 80+ games but were around for the playoffs

  
**Capitals (2018)**

Honestly, there top guys played 74 or more game . Oshie missing 8 games i would say is expected. Im shocked Ovi played a full 82

**Pens (2017)**

Oh boy Malkin only played 65 regular season games and Sheary played 61 games. and oh no Letang played 41. Ok letang fully missed playoffs, but oh whats this Malkin played 25 games and had 28 points! and sheary was there for 22 playoff games as well. Well Pens must have cheated, Malkin missed 27 games but played 25 in the playoffs

**Pens 2016 (thats right we went back to back)**

Oh heavens malkin only played 57 games this year. Well i dont need to know he played 23 playoff games posting 18 points to know him missing those 25 regular season games was a big reason why we won and not the HBK line popping off 

**Chicago (2015)**

Oh no Kane only played 61 games in the season guess we should take away the Blackhawks cup. Sharp only played 68 as well. Kane only scored 11 goals and 12 assists in 23 playoff games. Sharp only had 15 points in 23 games too. 

**Kings (2014)**

Toffoli was 8th in regular season season scoring ands was the first one below 77 games aside from Carters 72

**Chicago (2013)**

Lockout season. Hossa is the only one in top 8 regular season scoring under 76 games (he played 40) but sharp at 9th only played 28 game. SOUND THE FREAKING LTIR ALARMS as he went on to play 23 playoff games with 16 points

**Kings (2012)**

74 games was their lowest. It was by Kuznetsov's idol, Mike Richards!

**Bruins (2011)**

Lowest games played was 75 by Krecji unless you want to argue Paille was a key part to the cup in which case he played 43 games scoring 13 points in the regular season

**Chicago (2010)**

Well even in 2010 they abused LTIR Hossa only played 57 games, but the blackhawks won the cup with Hossa playing 22 playoff games and getting 25 points. 

&#x200B;

**Summary:**

since 2010. There has been 7 cup winners who had at least 1 player who was a key part on at least a very good playoff producer to their cup win that missed significant NHL regular season time. It has happened 6 times since Tampa brought up LTIR to the league in 2015. Almost like the front office game has evolved after chicago pointed out hey this LTIR its can benefit teams",2024-03-09 02:42:22,2024-03-09,new

The top three teams in each division automatically qualify for the playoffs. Then the next two best teams overall from the conference are wild cards, so in any conference, there will always be either four teams from one division, and four from the other, or five from one and three from the other, depending on where the wild card teams come from. 

Then, to set up the playoff bracket, the lower ranked wildcard team will play the higher ranked division winner, and the other wildcard team will play the other division winner. And the second and third teams from each division will face each other, and they will be in the same bracket as the top placed team in their division. And it’s a fixed bracket, no reseeding. 

Is that accurate? If so, why does the NHL do it like this? Why not just take the top eight teams overall from a conference? What’s the benefit of doing it this way? ",2024-03-08 16:28:44,2024-03-08,new

11. 18/19 Crosby: 100 in 79   
12. 16/17 McDavid: 100 in 82   

And this year’s McDavid has 100 in 59, and is on pace to finish with 136 in 80 games, which would place him 2nd here.   

**McDavid vs. Crosby at other scoring plateaus**   

McDavid also now has more seasons at each 10-point interval from 90 points to 150 points over Crosby.   

150-point seasons: 1-0 McDavid   
140-point seasons: 1-0 McDavid   
130-point seasons: 1-0 McDavid (McDavid on pace to make it 2-0 by the end of the year)   
120-point seasons: 2-1 McDavid (McDavid on pace to make it 3-1 by the end of the year)    
110-point seasons: 3-1 McDavid (McDavid on pace to make it 4-1 by the end of the year)   
100-point seasons: 7-6 McDavid   
90-point seasons: 8-7 McDavid   

Once you go down to 80-point seasons, Crosby takes the lead 12-8, and is on pace to add to that this year (on pace for 85 in 82 entering tonight’s game) to make it 13-8.   

**McDavid vs. Crosby per game**   

McDavid has been at a 100-point pace (over 82 games) in 8 of his 9 seasons, regardless of game count.      

Crosby has been at a 100-point pace in 10 of his 19 seasons, just missing the cut on an 11th in 2021/22 when he was just a shade under 100.   

Ranked together:   

1. 20/21 McDavid: 1.88 points per game (56 games)   
2. 22/23 McDavid: 1.87 (82 games)

If we then look at the same stat by division, we can see, that the columns for the Pacific and the Atlantic divisions are the same, but flipped. There are as many teams who have played 64 games in the Pacific as there are teams with 60 games played in the Atlantic, the same goes for 63 and 61 etc. The same thing happens when we compare the Central division and the Metropolitan division.

A first round exit team could trade which ever rentals they acquired at the deadline or any expiring players they kept for the run to a team still in the playoffs. A team that gave up assets could try and get some back, and a team that has the confidence after winning a round might be willing to dish out some assets for even further improved roster heading into the next series. Players get injured all the time during playoff series' too so it could be a quick bandaid moving into the next round if you can manage to win the series.

A player recording a point in all of their team’s home games in a season has been done 4 times before, but only once after the 1921/22 season, and it’s never been done in an 82-game season (with 41 home games).

2. Before that, Babe Dye recorded at least 1 point in all 12 home games the Toronto St. Pats played in the 24-game 1921/22 season. He had 19-3-22 totals.   

3. In the 18-game 1918/19 season, Frank Nighbor had a point in all 9 Ottawa Senators home games, with 11-6-17 totals.   

4. And then, as a technicality in the 22-game 1917/18 season, Jack McDonald was the only Montreal Wanderers player to record a point in all 3 home games they played, with 1 goal in each game… until their arena burned down and the team folded.

For those of you who may be unaware, the PWHL uses the 3-2-1-0 rule for standings, so 3p points for regulation win, 2 for OTW, 1 for OTL and 0 for regulation loss.

Your owners are billionaires and won’t open their pockets and load up. Your GMs are too scared of losing their jobs to trade prospects and picks. Fans are too attached to their players to see them get dealt even if there’s someone else better.

Be mad at your own franchises for not doing anything it takes to win. Look at the other major sports, who, by the way, bring in waaay more money than the NHL. This would be nothing in the NBA or MLB.

Xfinity Loses Local NHL Coverage Forever,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1b8hukv/xfinity_loses_local_nhl_coverage_forever/,0,nhl,"In a recent strategic maneuver, as of February 22nd, 2024, Xfinity has transitioned AT&T SportsNet to its ""Ultimate TV Package,"" a decision that notably increases the monthly cost for subscribers by $20. This adjustment places a substantial financial burden on fans of the Pittsburgh Penguins, compelling them to allocate at least $90 monthly solely for the privilege of viewing their beloved team's games from the comfort of their homes. Adding to the complexity, AT&T SportsNet is conspicuously absent from Xfinity's ""Sports Add-on"" package, a decision that sidelines the channel from other sports-focused content such as Redzone and the NHL Network, thereby limiting access for dedicated fans.

This development is symptomatic of a larger, more intricate dynamic within the telecommunications and broadcasting landscape, hinting at an ambitious and long-term strategy potentially in play. The historical context sheds light on a deep-seated rivalry and a series of strategic moves that have shaped the current state of affairs. The origins of this strategic positioning can be traced back to the era of Comcast, previously known as American Cable Systems, which had to rebrand in 2010 due to reputational challenges. The company's strategic territory contracts, established well before the internet's widespread adoption, effectively stifled competition and solidified Comcast's dominance in both cable and internet services.

The narrative takes a fascinating turn with the involvement of SBC Communications, later to become the modern AT&T, a company with a storied history and a significant footprint in telecommunications innovation. Following a period of strategic acquisitions and technological advancements, notably in mobile internet, AT&T re-emerged as a formidable conglomerate, poised to challenge the status quo.

The plot thickens with Comcast's venture into the realm of sports broadcasting, marked by the establishment of Comcast SportsNet. This move, coupled with strategic partnerships and acquisitions, hinted at a broader vision for regional sports dominance. However, the regulatory intervention in the form of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 introduced new dynamics, enabling competitors like AT&T to regain a foothold in the market.

Fast forward to the present, and the landscape of local sports broadcasting is at a critical juncture. AT&T SportsNet's strategic positioning in the NBA and NHL rights, alongside targeted market penetration, suggests a deliberate and calculated approach to reshaping local sports viewership. The avoidance of larger, more expensive markets and a focus on dedicated, regional fanbases indicates a nuanced strategy aimed at gradually eroding Comcast's stronghold, without triggering immediate, large-scale confrontations.

The culmination of these strategic moves hints at an overarching master plan by AT&T, aimed at revolutionizing the local sports broadcasting ecosystem. This vision entails a comprehensive overhaul of how regional sports are accessed and consumed, positioning AT&T as the central nexus for local sports content. By leveraging its technological capabilities, strategic partnerships, and a nuanced understanding of market dynamics, AT&T is poised to offer an unprecedented level of accessibility, quality, and engagement in local sports broadcasting.

In conclusion, AT&T's master plan is not merely about acquiring rights or expanding its portfolio but about fundamentally changing the paradigm of local sports consumption. Through a strategic blend of technological innovation, market acumen, and a deep understanding of consumer needs, AT&T aims to dismantle existing monopolies and establish a new standard for how fans engage with local sports, ultimately seeking to control the entire spectrum of live sports streaming for local professional sports. This bold vision represents a significant shift in the broadcasting landscape, promising to redefine the fan experience and reshape the future of sports entertainment.",2024-03-07 01:41:07,2024-03-07,new

"Do you think McDavid will be 3rd or 4th fastest ever to 1,000 points? (Needs 51 points in next 28 games to pass Mike Bossy for 3rd)",https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1b86e99/do_you_think_mcdavid_will_be_3rd_or_4th_fastest/,42,nhl,"McDavid is currently at 949 points in 627 games.   

Gretzky hit 1,000 in his 424th game for fastest ever, and Lemieux hit 1,000 in 513 games for 2nd fastest.   

**What McDavid needs to do to be 3rd fastest**   

3rd on the list is Mike Bossy, who got to 1,000 in his 656th game.   

In order to get to 1,000 by his 655th game, McDavid would need 51 points in his next 28 games (1.82 points per game average). McDavid has 22 games left this season, so his 1,000-point chase will likely go into next season.     

McDavid’s at 1.71 points per game this season, but has averaged over that 1.82 mark in 2 different seasons (1.87 in 2022/23 and 1.88 in 2020/21).   

This season, his highest point total in a 28-game span is 54 points, which ran from Dec. 30 up to last night. And the fewest games it’s taken him to record 51 points in any span this season was 26 games (Jan. 2 up to last night).    

The fewest games it’s ever taken him to rack up 51 points is 20, which was in a 20-game span split across the 2020/21 and 2021/22 seasons. And the most points he’s recorded in a 28-game stretch is 64, again split across the 2020/21 and 2021/22 seasons.         

**What McDavid needs to do to be 4th fastest**   

In order to be the 4th fastest to hit 1,000 points, he’d need to get there in 681 games (Peter Stastny is currently 4th on the list with 1,000 in 682 games).   

To get there faster than Stastny, McDavid needs to record 51 points in his next 54 games, and he’s never been at or under a point per game in any 54-game stretch of his career (worst stretch is 55 points in 54 games in 2016/17).   

And Jari Kurri is 5th fastest with 1,000 points in 716 games, so McDavid would need 51 points in his next 88 games to get there by 715 games. The worst 88-game stretch of McDavid’s career is 93 points in 88 games split across 2015/16 and 2016/17.",2024-03-06 17:59:06,2024-03-06,new

McDavid's case for the Hart trophy,https://i.redd.it/x0vfnn9sm0rc1.jpeg,0,nhl,"
First off, I'm fully aware of the predictable ""he never won it' bias that will populate the vote for the Hart, especially in the Colorado and Quebec media, the latter one looming large in the vote (Nate played in the Q). This is why I think it's time to start stating the case for McDavid as I believe, with plenty of arguments to support it, that McDavid should be the frontrunner IMHO. If you agree, please share this far and wide.



In order of importance 

1. The Oilers turnaround 

We are all familiar with the story. Despite McDavid and Draisaitl respectively getting 8 and 9 points in the first five games, the team was in complete disarray, bad defensive coverage, inefficient breakouts, getting otfen hemmed in the defensive zone. Nothing seemed to work other than the two juggernauts. After that, McDavid misses two games, two regulation losses, then comes back too quickly, following up with 2 points in 6 games until Woodcroft gets fired and Knoblauch gets hired. The team is 3-9-1 at that point. Knoblauch wins his two first games, loses the next three and McDavid has 6 points in 5 games. The team is 5-12-1 at that point, with McDavid getting a concerning and irregular 16 points in 16 games. 

Then the turnaround happens. 8 wins in a row, then 3 losses, then the great sequence of 16 wins. Since the 16 wins, they've leveled off a bit, playing around .650, with a 14-8-3 record. 

In total, they've been 38-11-3 in the last 52 games, topping the league with 79 points in that sequence (a 125/82 pace), a +27 win differential. 2nd closest was Carolina with 75 in 55, a +20 win differential. To put that into perspective, a team needs +18 in 82 games to get to 100 points. 

In that span, Edmonton led the league in GF/G, was 4th in GA/G, but most importantly, they've had the best +/- differential per game. 

A look at individual results on the team in that span is very revealing: 

McDavid
52gp 20g 83a 103pts
+38 74 primary points 70 ESP 

Draisaitl
52gp 32g 38a 70pts
+26 53 PRP 43 ESP 

Bouchard
52gp 11g 43a 54pts
+34 25 PRP 30 ESP 

Hyman
51gp 41g 12a 53pts
+32 49 PRP 39 ESP 

Nugent-Hopkins
52gp 14g 33a 47pts
+11 32 PRP 26 ESP 

Outscoring Draisaitl by 33 points in 52 games is one thing, but getting as many even-strenght points than Draisaitl had in total points is even more incredible. 

This alone IMO, that sequence since November 24th, makes McDavid the frontrunner. The Hart is supposed to be exactly about this type of accomplishment, literally carrying a team. McDavid participated in 52.3% of Edmonton's goals scored in those 52 games. Unfortunately, this kind of context is foreign to many who rather just look at raw totals, which brings me to number 2 on the list.



2. 50 primary assists in 49 games 

Before I go into this, I have to say I'm still in complete disbelief nobody caught this. Neither the NHL, Edmonton sports media or any other affiliated media has talked about this. No one seemed to notice and yet it's a very rare accomplishment. Primary assists can often be more important than the goal itself. I consider this feat just as amazing as 50/50 goals and its rarity proves that. 

Most would state McDavid's quite probable incoming 100 assists as the second reason, but this feat IMO should overshadow it. From the day the Oilers turnaround started on November 24th, up to last week, on March 21st, Connor had 50 primary assists in 49 games. A 50/50 for primary assists had happened only 11 times before, by only two players. Wayne & Mario. 99 had 9, while 66 did it twice. Last time was Mario Le Magnifique in 1991-1992, more than 30 years ago. The Great One's record for best 50/50 stands at 52 primary assists in 29 games, which he did from December 11th 1985 to Valentine's day in 1986. Mario did it in 47 and 48 games respectively. The closest after Wayne, Mario and now Connor, was Elmer Lach in the famous WW2 league-depleted season of 1944-1945 where his linemate, the Rocket, had the very first 50 goals in 50 games. That season, Lach had 47 primary assists in 50 games. Closest after that is Lafontaine with 44 in 50. After that, it dwindles out with only a few players going around 40 in 50.



3. 71 primary assists 

In the history of the league, only one player has ever had higher than 70 primary assists in a season. Who else than Wayne? In fact, he's the only player to actually finish higher than 1 primary assist per game for a complete season. His record stands at a whopping 112 primary assists. Two players stand at 70. Mario with 70 in 73 games and Joe Thornton with 70 in 81 games. 

Right now, Connor is at 58 on the season and considering he's had 27 of them in his last 22 games, it's feasible that he can end the season with 13 in 12 games, bringing him second only to Wayne.



4. 100++ assists. 

We're all more familiar with this one. Another select group. McDavid might even reach 110 when it's all said and done. He's more than likely to eclipse Bobby Orr and come close to Mario's best season at 114.



5. Back-to-back 60+ primary assists 

60 primary assists or more happened 27 times, by 14 players. Only one player had a back-to-back. In fact, Gretzky had a whopping 11 in a row and an equal 11 in career total. McDavid needs only 2 primary assists in the last 12 games to become the second player to do it. He will also tie Denis Savard with two total. Mario is second to Wayne with 3 seasons of 60+ primary assists.



6. 90 to 95 Even-strenght points 

Johnny Gaudreau had quite a season a few years back, notching 90 even-strenght points. It was the highest finish since Jagr had 95 in 1995-1996. Second to Gaudreau since Jagr is McDavid last year with 84. Right now, Mack has 80, Kuch 79 and McDavid has 78, but the latter had 70 of those 78 in the last 52 games. Out of the three, McDavid is the most likely to pass 90. He needs 17 in his last 12 to catch Jagr, just a notch over his average in the last 52 games.



7. Carrying Hyman 

Now, don't knee-jerk. Hyman's accomplishment is great no matter what, but let's get real here. There are maybe 2 other players in the league who 'might' push Hyman to 50 goals. It's hypothetical. Still, Connor assisted 33 of Hyman's 51 goals so far. 23 of them were primary assists. To contrast this, we often hear how Bobby Orr carried Bucyk to 51 goals by assisting 25 of them.



8. The Art Ross race 

IMO, it would be completely unfair to McDavid to punish him for playing injured early on. Compare McDavid's rates in the last 52 games to Mack and Kuch's entire seasons and a different picture emerges than the tight race we're witnessing right now. It explains why McDavid has made-up so much ground, despite both players having career seasons. 

Pts/Gp
McDavid 1.98
Kucherov 1.75
Mackinnon 1.71 

Primary Pts/Gp
McDavid 1.42
Kucherov 1.28
Mackinnon 1.19 

ESP/Gp
McDavid 1.35
Mackinnon 1.11
Kucherov 1.11 

P/Gp gap with 2nd best teammate
McDavid vs Draisaitl +0.63
Kucherov vs Point +0.61
Mackinnon vs Rantanen +0.36 

Also interesting to note, McDavid's average TOI is 21:29 in those 52 games, which is less than either Kuch or Mack, whether over the entire season or Connor's last 52 games, which means McDavid distanced them even more in terms of per60. 

McDavid's team leading +36 in the last 52 games and all those other stats is the main reason why the Oilers have dominated the league in that span. To me, it's simply a much bigger story than whatever people want to cook-up for Mack or Kuch, but naturally, people will gloss over season totals and proclaim voter fatigue.",2024-03-28 06:03:12,2024-03-28,hot

Only ONE point separates Vancouver in first from Boston in seventh. If the NHL were more culturally similar to European soccer, where finishing first in the league is a hugely prestigious achievement, then the next few weeks would be one of the most electric “title races” of all time. But in reality, even though there is technically a trophy on the line, no one really cares about it including the teams themselves. Some fans genuinely root for their team NOT to win it to avoid bad luck.

The home stretch of the season could be so much more exciting than nervously waiting for the playoffs to start. Of course there’s still the jockeying for playoff seeding, but it doesn’t feel that meaningful when we all know unexpected teams catch fire every spring. I think North American sports fans have an “all-or-nothing” mentality where only pursuing the playoff championship matters whatsoever, as opposed to Europe where there’s this concept of multiple trophies of varying prestige. Obviously the Stanley Cup should still be king, but the end of the season could be a thrilling lead-in to the main event of the playoffs if the hockey community ascribed SOME importance to the President’s Trophy.

Edit - a lot of people are talking about needing to add some kind of reward like a draft pick to make it relevant. I’m saying it should be relevant in and of itself. Why does winning the Cup matter?

Bossy- amongst players with at least 200 goals, Bossy is the all time leader at goals per game with 0.76. Unfortunately, his career got cut short abruptly with his back. His last year was the only year he didn’t score at least 50 goals and he still scored 38 that year.

Lemieux- Mario is second at goals per game at 0.75 and that’s only because of his second run. At the conclusion of ‘97, he was at 0.82. He lost a lot of time because of injury and illness. A healthy Lemieux is probably pushing 1000 goals.

Gretzky- he’s at 0.60 like Ovechkin. Wayne’s goal scoring pace dipped once he got to LA but his scoring in Edmonton was unreal.


Another to watch for is Auston Matthews. He’s at 0.65 right now. We’ll see how his career pans. Hopefully he’s blessed with longevity. ",2024-03-24 19:29:39,2024-03-24,hot

Items could include a single play, a single player/coach or maybe a more general or blanket item: 

* If only our team didn't have goalie issues
* If only \[player X\] didn't get injured
* If only our defense didn't struggle

As an example my Dallas Stars was a high flying offense in 2015-16 but our defense struggled that year in front of Kari Lehtonen who either stood on his head or let beach balls in - no in between. Went to 7 games against St. Louis in round two but man, if we just had a halfway decent defense that year we could have went all the way. We clinched the conference in the season with 109 points, we had Benn and Seguin (aka ""Benneguin"") at their all-time primes, had Spezza, P. Sharp, Hemsky, Eakin, Nichushkin, etc up front and they absolutely dominated all season.

Wilson was offered the in-person hearing earlier Thursday, indicating a potential suspension of six games or more for the repeat offender.""

"The ""situation room"" needs more frames per second to make offside calls",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1bkrzl6,35,nhl,"I am neither a Vegas nor Seattle fan, but watched the game tonight and this was pretty silly. Vegas is definitely offside, based on the puck speed vs skater speed at this moment, and the only reason the league doesn't overturn this goal is because for some reason this camera runs at what seems to be 30fps (or 29.976 if we're getting specific). Why does a camera exist that is SPECIFICALLY for offside reviews that does not constantly run in slow motion? Being to see even one frame between these two images would be enough to conclusively say this was offside.

I am, very generally speaking, annoyed by the offside reviews in general and how long some of them take. I feel like higher frame rates (at least 60fps, please) would make this a LOT more cut-and-dry.

3. We might see a more human side to them and develop a sense of empathy with regard to the difficulty that comes with pro reffing

Pulling your goalie on a powerplay? Maybe if....?,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1bkr0vz/pulling_your_goalie_on_a_powerplay_maybe_if/,0,nhl,"Coaches are pulling goalies more often earlier than ever before. If I understand correctly, analytics say it's worth it to try anything to at least get a point forcing an overtime, as well as a loss is a loss. There is no standings penalty for how many goals you lose by. Why does that reasoning never carry over to a losing team pulling a goalie on a powerplay, in situations where statistics say the team will most likely lose anyway? Example would be maybe down by 3 goals in the third, especially vs. teams that rarely lose when ahead by X goals. Here are my reasons to think it could be a valid strategy. First, I think a 6 on 4 is highly unlikely to give up an empty netter by anything other than a lucky shot from the defensive zone. I can't see six skaters allowing the team of 4 advancing anywhere past the neutral zone. The 6 on 4 also allows the attacking team an extra man to clear out and own the slot in front of the crease. If I remember correctly, stats year to year show the team leading by x amount of goals heading into the third, wins the game 80%-90% of the time. Is that enough to make a case for trying this under any circumstances? Sorry long read, I went on and on.",2024-03-22 04:35:43,2024-03-22,hot

Am I the only one that wants to do away with most offside challenges?,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1bkfkgu/am_i_the_only_one_that_wants_to_do_away_with_most/,0,nhl,"The fundamental purpose of offsides is, and always has been to avoid one team gaining an advantage by either camping in the offensive zone  and cherry picking goals, or otherwise having a teammate zoom ahead of the play to try and take a break away pass behind the defence. That still happens to some extent, but it's limited to passes just on-side of the blue line, which still gives the defence some time to catch the player. Even then, we don't see an abundance of players camping at the blue line, because that takes them out of the play and gives the other team an effective power play in your zone. 

With the replay rules as they are, what we are seeing is that if there was an offsides at any point before a goal, the goal will be wiped out and the clock reset *unless* the zone was cleared after the offsides. So there could be 30 seconds of cycling in the O-zone after an offside all for nothing.

Also for all practical purposes, any offside that is subject to replay is going to be a matter of inches. linesmen don't miss players 10 feet into the zone. Those are going to be called. Replay catches offsides that are so close that the linesman couldn't tell. That is not likely to be a system that teams would have any way to intentionally exploit of the rule was changed.

In my opinion, ""unless the zone is cleared"" is too long a window. In my view, if the puck is brought in offsides, and that team scores directly on the initial rush into the zone, that should be repayable, because an offside could have had a usually (marginal) effect on the defence and the goal being scored.

But once the initial rush is over, maybe once 5 seconds have passed or once the defensive team has possessed the puck and there's been a turnover back to the offensive team, or once there have been 5 passes or some other metric - once that initial rush is over, the offside has no bearing on the play - the defence has had a chance to reset and there's no unfair advantage anymore where we need to call a goal back because of an extremely close offside 30 seconds earlier.

It sucks a bunch of energy out of the game and the arena, and takes a bunch of time. Even as a fan of the team who wins the challenge, I don't get a rush of excitement when a call goes our way in those circumstances.

Similarly, a missed hand pass or puck touched by a high stick - unless those plays lead *directly* to a goal - like the goal is scored within 2 passes, it doesn't seem like the kind of thing we need to go back 40 seconds and call, and replay 40 seconds of game.

In a game where lots of penalties are subjective and ""missed"" in fan eyes all the time, and even things like icing are subjective and ""missed"" at times, it doesn't seem like the problem that needs fixing are simple stoppages for trivial infractions like a hand pass or touched by high stick that don't directly cause a goal. I've literally never seen a fan get up in arms at a hand pass that wasn't called. Hand on puck or puck gloved into the net? Sure. But not a hand pass or a touched by high stick.

If there was a penalty called on the play to begin with, then no instigating penalty. I know it’s hard to tell for sure what the intent was, but most of the time it’s pretty clear that it’s a retaliation to a specific check.

During Lebron James’ stay here, all we ever heard was when Lebron planned on leaving Cleveland for a more glamorous market. Obviously, it happened twice, the second time, not as bad as the first. On the flip side, why wasn’t there ever much national debate about if/when Crosby was going to leave Pittsburgh? The two cities are relatively similar in size and are not Chicago, New York, Miami, LA esque hotbeds for nightlife and exposure. I’ve just been baffled by how the greatest basketball player of his era was constantly getting berated with that question, and the greatest hockey player of his era either seldom was or never was pressured to go somewhere more glamorous than Pittsburgh. If you think about it, they’ve been in their professional leagues for close to the same amount of time.

Hypothetical: NHL Lockout,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1bjwmv2/hypothetical_nhl_lockout/,0,nhl,"So as most know in 2004-05 the NHL had a lockout and did not compete for the Stanley Cup, given that the Stanley Cup does not belong to the NHL the board of trustees elected to not allow for other contenders, and in 2012 I believe they made a ruling that pretty much says that the Stanley Cup does not belong to the NHL, but the NHL is the only league that's allowed to compete for it. 

My question is, if the next lockout the trustees decided that they would let another league/leagues compete for it who would? I'd assume the AHL and ECHL would be out since they are minor leagues of the NHL so their contracts are probably with the NHLPA too (unless I'm wrong), and it couldn't be a league like Liiga since it's not in North America.

Secondly, would you guys support this or feel like it is a stain on the cup to possibly have some beer league on it. Personally, I would be all for it, thinking that years from now someone could be researching Stanley Cup champions, watching some video on Youtube, and come across this anomaly.

So basically... when I was around 10 or 11, I obviously didn't know what hockey was, nobody in my family watched sports really.
But thats when the internet came. And basically, I came across basically a ranking of all the 31 NHL teams at the time. 
And that's when I was interested as a kid. The logos of the NHL teams were really cool.
The one that started it was the Arizona Coyotes (the one before the 2021 change). I know, looking back I know that most people don't like that logo, but hey! I thought a coyote howling was cool. I looked it up a bit more, found out what NHL was, starting researching the basic rules of hockey.
But then, the team that really got me into it was the San Jose Sharks. Wow, little me thought that was the most coolest thing ever. I lived in Northern California at the time too, so i LOVED the San Jose Sharks when I was little. They were the first ever sports and hockey game I went to (funny enough the game was San Jose Sharks VS Arizonia Coyotes). I didn't even know the basics of sports like Goalies, Defense, all that! I just loved the experience, and that goal horn too!! I remember drawing the logo a bunch when I was younger. 
I stopped getting into hockey for a while until recently when I moved close to a hockey arena, now with all my knowledge I know about the NHL, I couldn't help but look back and see how funny this all really was.
Most people got into hockey because their family watched it or they play it, but I got into it because of a simple Google search I did when I was young!",2024-03-19 01:23:37,2024-03-19,hot

 there’s absolutely some recency bias in here, which I think is fair. The game is growing and improving, and players are constantly getting more skilled. That’s not to say all history should be overlooked though. 

it’s hard to balance elite ppg with truncated careers, especially among different eras. looking at Bossy and Orr (not so much Lemieux), it’s hard for me to place them.

Ovechkin feels like a stretch to me, but it’s hard to have a top 10 without the leading goal scorer of all time on it (yes, i’m assuming things).

Montreal Canadiens - The most glorious and historical team ever in hockey! 💙⚜️💙,https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/montreal-canadiens,0,nhl,"The Montreal Canadiens are the oldest professional hockey team in the world and one of the most storied franchises in professional sports. Founded in 1909 and officially called the Club de Hockey Canadien, the team (also known as the Les Habitants, or Habs for short) is the only existing National Hockey League (NHL) franchise to have formed prior to the league’s inception in 1917.

In 1917, the Canadiens took to the ice in new uniforms with a new crest — a stylized C with an H in the middle. The letters in the crest symbolized the team’s new official name, the Club de Hockey Canadien. The H in the logo stands for hockey, not habitant, as many believe. This misconception apparently originated with Madison Square Garden owner Tex Rickard, who mistakenly told a reporter in 1924 that the H stood for habitant. The word — the name for land-owning settlers of New France — was by then a common nickname for the team. The first known reference to the Canadiens as the “Habitants” was in Le Devoir on 9 February 1914, in the description of a game against a team from Toronto. (“Sans contredit les ‘Habitants’ eurent l’avantage continuellement.”/ “Without a doubt, the ‘Habitants’ constantly had the edge.”) The term’s association with the club is believed to stem from the fact that the team was marketed as the city’s French hockey club, as opposed to the English team, the Montreal Wanderers. In those early years, many Canadiens fans would even show their affiliation with the club by attending games in traditional habitant attire such as tuques, moccasins and brightly colored sashes.

More recently, however, the term habitant has fallen out of favour with French Canadians, who see it as a derogatory word generally meaning “uncouth peasant.” As Mark Abley has explained, “In contemporary French, if you have ‘habitant manners’ you’re a country bumpkin. If you want to disparage the traditional folksongs of the province, call them ‘habitant music.’ As they turned their backs on the Roman Catholic church and the agricultural past, Quebecers rejected many of the symbols they had once held dear — habitants among them.” (See Habitants and French-Speaking Quebec.) Abley has also explained that the shortened version of the term, habs, “does not suffer from the negative associations of ‘habitant’.",2024-03-18 20:47:08,2024-03-18,hot

Could a goaltender ever have a season as good as Bernie Parent's 1973-74 season ever again?,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1bh86b5/could_a_goaltender_ever_have_a_season_as_good_as/,6,nhl,"Bernie Parent may not have had as many seasons with high acclaim as the other legends who played in his time, but the fact that a goalie was able to achieve these numbers in the stand-up era, let alone at any point in history, is staggering:  


* 72.7 Goals Saved Above Average in regular Season, 11.9 GSAA in 17 postseason games
* 19.9 Goalie Points Share, 63 GA %-Minus in regular season
* 12 shutouts over 73 regular season games played
* .736 points % with a 47-13-12 record

While it's possible that this isn't the greatest season of goaltending ever witnessed, this is definitely the greatest season that has stats to back it up.  Hasek, Roy and Brodeur couldn't come close to this level of greatness in the dead puck era.  But, with the future of hockey looking more and more talented every year, is it out of the question to think that the goalies of the future could be even greater than the names I just mentioned?

Why is Kucherov not the Hart favorite?,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1bhvy56/why_is_kucherov_not_the_hart_favorite/,0,nhl,"as of 3/18/24 the stats for the major finalists are:

Mackinnon: 68 gp 42g 74a 116p

Kucherov: 66 gp 40g 74a 114p

McDavid: 63 gp 25g 81a 106p

Matthews: 65 gp 55g 27a 82p

My interpretation of the Hart trophy is the player that is the most valuable to their team’s success. We saw a precedent set when Taylor Hall won the Hart over Mackinnon in 2017-18, which was rationalized by Hall carrying the devils to the playoffs, having 41 points more than the second highest scoring player on his team. The Hart is also typically given to historical seasons, which would likely be given to Matthews if he reaches 70 goals (on pace for 69 in 82gp) or McDavid with 100 assists (on pace for 105 in 82gp)

Nikita Kucherov trails Mackinnon by 2 points for most points in the league, but has played 2 less games. He is dragging the Lightning into the 1st WC spot in the east, in a year where he has 41 points more than the second scorer on his team (Point with 73). We have literally seen this exact situation before. 

Mackinnon is the current favorite. He has the help of Rantanen (6th in points with 90) and Makar (T17th in points with 74). The Avalanche aren’t president trophy locks or in trouble of missing the playoffs. It seems like people really want to give him an MVP. He’s a great player and injuries have limited him from previous MVP campaigns. As much as this year seems to be “his year,” it really should not be unless he has a finish that seperates him from the pack. 

I don’t understand why Kucherov is not the favorite. Despite people wanting Mackinnon to receive his rightful MVP and spiting Kucherov for all star weekend, there isn’t a valid argument to be made against Kucherov in my opinion.

I’ve been a Leaf fan since I was a wee lad cheering on Clark, Gilmour, Potvin and company. It’s been a turbulent ride and I’ve endured all the regular season AND playoff collapses but my issue is not with the players or management. It’s the fans.

We have the worst fan base in the NHL. We go way beyond criticism to the point of outright vilification. This narrative has been building and I think it has some traction. Maybe, since we are so hard on the players and even run some of them out of town, WE are to blame for some of their shortcomings. 

Imagine being out on the ice knowing what treatment you’ll receive if you give the puck away or miss an empty net. Maybe we are causing them to grip their sticks a little tighter. I understand they are professional hockey players being paid millions of dollars, but they are human. 

I doubt this is received well but sometimes it’s not easy being part of this toxic fan base. Be critical, it’s your right as a fan, but do we have to get to the point where players actually don’t want to play here because of us? Is it possible we are actually part of the problem that has lead to numerous playoff failures?

I don’t know the answer but I know being a mean, toxic fan can’t help. ",2024-03-18 13:37:44,2024-03-18,hot

Top Goal Scorers Under 30,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1bfbm2t/top_goal_scorers_under_30/,6,nhl,"I was looking through the top goal scorers under 30 and saw some surprising results in goals per game. Only requirement was at least 150 (Kaprizov has 148) goals scored in their career so far. 

1. Austin Matthews - .650 G/GP

2. Kirill Kaprizov - .563 G/GP

3. Connor McDavid - .520 G/GP

4. David Pastrnak - .518 G/GP

5. Leon Draisaitl - .483 G/GP

6. Kyle Connor -  .458 G/GP

7. Mikko Rantanen - .456 G/GP

8. Brayden Point - .450 G/GP

9. Jake Guentzel - .434 G/GP

10. Patrick Laine - .425 G/GP


A couple things I found interesting were how elite of a goal scorer Kaprizov is. I knew he was among the leagues best, but he’s been consistently good at scoring goals since going the league. He is on pace for his third straight 40 goal season. Had he played a full season his rookie year he would likely have 4 straight 40 goal seasons to start his NHL career. 

 Patrick Laine at #10 is strange to see. He lot the league up early in his career, but has been plagued with injuries ever since. Also, he’s only 25. If he can find some health he could really start putting some numbers up. 

It’s crazy seeing just how elite Matthews is. He’s a full point ahead of Kaprizov.  He ranks 5th all time for G/GP. If he can play a long career we could see him climb high up the all time goals list. I think it’s safe to say he will be the number one goals scored for an American by the time his career is over.

GOAT Debate /// ***Spoiler Alert*** It's not Wayne and won't be McDavid,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1bgdza9/goat_debate_spoiler_alert_its_not_wayne_and_wont/,0,nhl,"Can we all agree that Sidney Crosby is the greatest hockey player of all time? I think if we accept realistic facts instead of harboring these notions that they each did what they did when they did it, we can all agree that obviously we are in the most competitive era of hockey. Skills are higher, players are bigger, pressure is greater, money is more. Everything about the game has surpassed beyond crediting guys like Orr, Gretzky, Lemuix, Hull, Howe.....etc....other than giving them the credit that they were the greatest of the pioneers for the game. Yes, Wayne is the 'nostalgic GOAT' but what Sid has done since Day 1 in this era should make him the clear vote for greatest. Scoring is harder, plays are more complex, lanes are smaller. Everything about the game has inflated, why are we hanging on to a legacy set in a generation prior.

I will also say that I don't think even McDavid will surpass Crosby. Sadly, even as a die-hard Oilers fan, I think that having gone this long without winning 1 or more SC's has prevented him from ever surpassing Sid, unless he wins 4-5 cups from now forward.

Everything fell in to it's perfect spot for Sidney. The timing was perfect for everything he accomplished and he was fortunate to be able to not only play in the Olympics but also win a Gold but also GET THE GAME WINNING GOLD MEDAL GOAL.

I know McDavid is on another level, but I still feel that on a general scale Sidney Crosby is the greatest to every play the game.

With the recent rash of fights in the league courtesy of Rempe, I went down the rabbit hole of those the game had lost due to suicides from head injuries stemming from fighting because that was their role in the game.   

Really sad it is the only way some guys can stay in the game.   Beyond the fighting aspect, there is other plays that can lead to this as well, namely cheap shots to the head.   What can the game do to improve upon this? Are the measures in place to penalize players who target the head enough?   More can always be done by it feels like the rules are being mocked and players are still doing it with little repercussions when DoPS actually does anything about it.  

Would like to encourage a healthy discussion on the topic but I think it needs a deep forensic analysis on this aspect of the game we all love and enjoy, but the human toll just isn't being addressed enough.  ",2024-03-14 09:48:59,2024-03-14,hot

Bumping into players. ,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1bd54u8/bumping_into_players/,191,nhl,"I was in LAX on Saturday flying back to STL. There was a security issue upstairs so everyone in the Southwest terminal had to be dropped off and wait downstairs at baggage claim until it was resolved (suspicious bag). Even though it was early (0530) there were still a lot of people starting to pile up inside. 

When we were finally released to go, I was in line to get to the elevator and coming in through the doors I saw a guy with a baggage trolley loaded down with 3 hockey bags and a bundle of goalie sticks (like at least 7). I saw the bags said Americans so I asked “is that the Rochester Americans?” And he said yeah that he had just gotten traded from Buffalo to San Jose. 

I LOVE hockey. I have absolutely made it atleast 3/4 of my personality by now. But I still don’t know every player on every team in the NHL and AHL. I didn’t have a clue who he was but I asked him if he was excited to get away from the cold. He said he was happy to be traded because he’s from San Jose and I exchanged words with him about how I was happy he would be across so many time zones because as someone who’s in the military I know how hard it is to have a large time distance for communication purposes. 
I helped him upstairs and to get to the line he needed to be in because he was an A-list member. He was super sweet and didn’t seem to mind my early morning chattering (I have ADHD and Adderall really gets me going). 

Devin Cooley is a really sweet guy and super stoked to be playing for the team he’s loved since he was a kid. In STL we love our hometown boys so I hope you San Jose fans show him lots of love when he comes up to play his first game with yall.

Team Concept Ideas...,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1bdh5sd/team_concept_ideas/,0,nhl,"With the trek to return hockey to Georgia potentially making some positive progress lately, I've looked into creating concepts for what the team may look like. With that, I thought I'd come to reddit and get some feedback on what very well may be my submission to what they team would be if we actually get one back.

I've gotten some names and concepts down, such as the Atlanta Inferno, Peach State Incinerators (you can sub the two location names for each other), etc. Some names I've thought of don't have staying power and some i cant use because other teams use something similar or an exact name that could potentially cause legal issues, so while the drawing/design phase hasn't happened yet, I'm still getting stumped at times.

As of now, I have maybe 2-3 ideas for logos and they could all very well be shoulder patch alts or secondary logos. First, for the Atlanta Inferno/Incinerators, a flaming A on top of a shield. This logo would be paying homage to both our former teams. Secondly, the Peach State version of those names would have a heart-shaped peach on fire, maybe with the flames forming a leaf. And lastly, a torch representing an I that could be used for Atlanta and/or Peach State; Maybe the flame of the torch could be either an A or PS for the initials of whatever the team uses.

Really all I want to know is what you guys think a team could be named or look like if we got one back. I live making fictional team concepts and hope this could benefit me in making a career outta designing for sports teams/leagues.",2024-03-13 03:14:10,2024-03-13,hot

And there are definitely a lot of things wrong with how hockey is played in the NHL relative to the ECHL. 

* First of all, the ECHL plays on a smaller rink surface, leading to more chaos during the games
* More physicality, a biproduct of the smaller surface. there are often scrums after every time the goalie freezes the puck, and much more fighting.
* All of our teams use Rock and Roll Part 2 by Gary Glitter as a goal song. The royalties don't go to his bank account anymore because he is a fugitive on the run, so its ethical to use (Bring back the ""Hey, You Suck!"" chant in the NHL. As an Everblades fan, that is one of, if not my favorite part of the goal song/ horn combo)
* Tickets are way too fucking expensive, I get that everyone from the Jets fan's to the Toronto City Zoo bitch about standing room ticket purchases requiring the house to be refinanced, but $50 each for nosebleeds? Seriously?
* More fan interaction: I get that it's easier to do this in a 7,500 person ECHL rink, and not so much an NHL rink, but is it that hard to have like 3 people in mascot suits running around the lower and upper bowls? (Not at the same time, likely staggered)
* Bring the elevation of the upper bowl down, no one in the nose bleeds has a shot at getting a puck that went out of play.
* More. Cowbells.
* End the whole streaming shit, it's dumb. Just do a FloHockey thing where you charge an extremely high amount of money upfront for an entire seasons worth of coverage of the entire league. The NHL would probably make more money doing this, as there isn't a bunch of money grubbing execs trying to take ad revenue from the NHL
* Merge the NHL and AHL into a super league, and doe something like MLB, where you have the National League, and American League. ECHL then becomes a little more crowded, which then requires a fourth single A affiliate league. (NFL and MLB do American Vs. National, why can't we?)
* Not really an ECHL thing, but do 10 minutes of 3 on 3 OT, without sudden death. 
* Put NHL teams in places that already have NBA teams (Stadiums literally just sitting there, waiting for an iceplant and a goal horn to be installed.",2024-03-13 05:25:52,2024-03-13,hot

Normally I see a couple days between games and if it’s any longer there’s a reason such as all-star weekend or a road trip coming up. There’s actually nothing going on that warrants a week and a half off, but I’m assuming this is a normal occurrence near the end of the regular season as players start to become worn out. The leafs schedule has been so relaxed for 2 months. seems like theyre paid a lot of money not to play or travel there’s no excuse why they still losing against teams with way more hectic schedule. so basically the scheduling is not fair around the league? some teams are at an advantage due to parts of the season like this where the leafs get to take it easy and chill ",2024-03-12 14:41:12,2024-03-12,hot

I am assuming there are procedures in place as this is not a new phenomenon. Im sure every team has a group of lawyers & professional that deal with this daily.

Here are my questions…

1. Do teams US teams need work visa to enter/play Canadian teams? Furthermore are US players taxes a portion of their salaries considering they are “working” 

2. How do teams deal with their international players? Are they all on extended work visas of some sort or do a lot of players apply for citizenship? Is money still owed to their native countries? 

3. Not sure if this is still a thing but as the AHL systems has shifted around since i last checked but I remember back in the day Ottawa & Vancouver had their AHL affiliates in NY. To me it sounds like a big hassle to call up players for all the same reasons mentioned above.

All I want is just a humble discussion about everyone favorite players, it can be all time favorites, or even favorites of this season. I'll start!

My favorite player of all time is Dion Phaneuf. I grew up watching Toronto all the time, and he was always my favorite player. As he was a really good player nice all arounder, great skating, physical with a hard shot and not to mention an awesome Captain. Even though I wasn't watching Hockey at the time he was traded it still made me really sad to hear it. And in my opinion is one of Toronto's worst trade decisions. He was my childhood hero, and I was saddened not to see his retirement.

As for my favorite player currently, I'd say Mark Scheifele or Adam Lowry as I'm a Winnipeg guy and they remind me a lot of Dion. In that both of Scheifele and Lowry are amazing all around, and Lowry really knows how to get the team going! Like when Winnipeg is down in a game, he tries his damnest to get them going which I love in a Captain.

I don’t know what’s wilder, the stat in the headline or the fact that Crosby only won the Art Ross twice. Obviously without injuries it would probably be one or two more, but still. Found that interesting. 

Edit: this isn’t a negative comment on Crosby for all the babies in the comments. He’s one of the greatest players of all time clearly. 

**Ive seen the light, McDavid sucks because he hasn’t won a cup. Clearly when I posted it, I implied that no one cares about the Cup at all, so that was cool that you all picked up on it. Ridiculous.

Bedard has the 2nd worst +/- through a forward’s first 50 games in NHL history and the worst in the last 49 years,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1bb05pv/bedard_has_the_2nd_worst_through_a_forwards_first/,0,nhl,"50 games into his career, Bedard is -37, which ties him for 2nd worst in NHL history (stat started being tracked in the 1959/60 season) with 1972/73 Dave Hudson, who played for the 12-60-8 Islanders in their expansion season.   

The worst is Mike Marson, who was -40 after his first 50 games with the Capitals in their 1974/75 expansion season, where they went 8-67-5. Marson was actually +3 over his 51st and 52nd games, so Bedard will likely be the worst ever over the next couple games if he gets at least -1.    

There are 9 defensemen who have had a worse +/- than Bedard’s -37 through 50 games, the worst being 1974/75 Greg Joly, who was -71 for those same Capitals through 1974/75 and 1975/76.    

The most recent D-man with a worse +/- than Bedard is Pat MacLeod at -50 (2nd worst through first 50 games behind Joly). His first 50 games played came with the 1990/91 North Stars, and 91/92-92/93 Sharks. He only played 53 total games in his career and was an IHL/SHL/ECHL player otherwise.   

**Bedard compared to post-lockout players**    

The only forwards to be -25 or worse in their first 50 career games post-2004/05 lockout are:   

1. Connor Bedard: -37 (2023/24 Blackhawks)      
2. Enver Lisin: -31 (06/07-08/09 Coyotes)   
3. Alex Wennberg: -29 (14/15 Blue Jackets)   
4. Yegor Chinakov: -25 (21/22 Blue Jackets)   

The worst totals (-25 or worse) for defensemen post-lockout are:   

1. Isaak Phillips: -35 (21/22-23/24 Blackhawks)   
2. Taylor Chorney: -28 (08/09-10/11 Oilers)   
3. Jackson LaCombe: -26 (22/23-23/24 Ducks)   
4. Rasmus Ristolainen: -26 (13/14-14/15 Sabres)   

**Worst 50-game stretches for any player since the lockout**   

Since the 2004/05 lockout, the only forward to have a worse 50-game stretch in a season than Bedard is Andreas Athanasiou, who was -45 in a 50-game stretch for the Wings in 2019/20.   

The only defenseman with a worse 50-game stretch since the lockout than Bedard is Nick Leddy at -44 for the 2017/18 Islanders.",2024-03-10 03:13:05,2024-03-10,hot

Am I understanding the NHL playoff bracket / qualification correctly?,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1b9s9bk/am_i_understanding_the_nhl_playoff_bracket/,2,nhl,"I know there are two conferences, and two divisions each within the conference.

The top three teams in each division automatically qualify for the playoffs. Then the next two best teams overall from the conference are wild cards, so in any conference, there will always be either four teams from one division, and four from the other, or five from one and three from the other, depending on where the wild card teams come from. 

Then, to set up the playoff bracket, the lower ranked wildcard team will play the higher ranked division winner, and the other wildcard team will play the other division winner. And the second and third teams from each division will face each other, and they will be in the same bracket as the top placed team in their division. And it’s a fixed bracket, no reseeding. 

Is that accurate? If so, why does the NHL do it like this? Why not just take the top eight teams overall from a conference? What’s the benefit of doing it this way? ",2024-03-08 16:28:44,2024-03-08,hot

"McDavid now has more 100-point seasons (7) than Crosby (6), and is tied for 4th most all-time behind Gretzky, Lemieux and Dionne",https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1b9atsv/mcdavid_now_has_more_100point_seasons_7_than/,28,nhl,"With an assist tonight, McDavid has now hit 100 points in 7 of the 9 seasons in his career, the exceptions being his injury-shortened 2015/16 rookie year where he had 48 in 45, and his 2019/20 COVID-shortened year where he had 97 in 64.   

7 seasons with 100 points is tied for the 4th most ever with Peter Stastny (15 seasons played) and Mike Bossy (10 seasons played), and moves him past a group of 10 players (including Crosby) that all hit 100 6 times.  

Ahead of McDavid for most 100-point seasons:   

Wayne Gretzky: 15 (in 20 seasons)     
Mario Lemieux: 10 (in 17 seasons)      
Marcel Dionne: 8 (in 18 seasons)         

**McDavid vs. Crosby**   

Fastest to reach 100 points between the two each season is:   

1. 20/21 McDavid: 53 games   
2. 22/23 McDavid: 56 games   
3. 23/24 McDavid: 59 games   
4. 06/07 Crosby: 65 games   
5. 18/19 McDavid: 66 games   
6. 21/22 McDavid: 67 games   
7. 08/09 Crosby: 75 games   
8. 13/14 Crosby: 76 games   
9. 17/18 McDavid: 77 games   
10. 09/10 Crosby: 78 games   
11. 18/19 Crosby: 79 games   
12. 05/06 Crosby: 80 games   
13. 16/17 McDavid: 82 games   

And best finishes:   

1. 22/23 McDavid: 153 points in 82 games   
2. 21/22 McDavid: 123 in 80   
3. 06/07 Crosby: 120 in 79   
4. 18/19 McDavid: 116 in 78    
5. 09/10 Crosby: 109 in 81   
6. 17/18 McDavid: 108 in 82   
7. 20/21 McDavid: 105 in 56   
8. 13/14 Crosby: 104 in 80    
9. 08/09 Crosby: 103 in 77   
10. 05/06 Crosby: 102 in 81   
11. 18/19 Crosby: 100 in 79   
12. 16/17 McDavid: 100 in 82   

And this year’s McDavid has 100 in 59, and is on pace to finish with 136 in 80 games, which would place him 2nd here.   

**McDavid vs. Crosby at other scoring plateaus**   

McDavid also now has more seasons at each 10-point interval from 90 points to 150 points over Crosby.   

150-point seasons: 1-0 McDavid   
140-point seasons: 1-0 McDavid   
130-point seasons: 1-0 McDavid (McDavid on pace to make it 2-0 by the end of the year)   
120-point seasons: 2-1 McDavid (McDavid on pace to make it 3-1 by the end of the year)    
110-point seasons: 3-1 McDavid (McDavid on pace to make it 4-1 by the end of the year)   
100-point seasons: 7-6 McDavid   
90-point seasons: 8-7 McDavid   

Once you go down to 80-point seasons, Crosby takes the lead 12-8, and is on pace to add to that this year (on pace for 85 in 82 entering tonight’s game) to make it 13-8.   

**McDavid vs. Crosby per game**   

McDavid has been at a 100-point pace (over 82 games) in 8 of his 9 seasons, regardless of game count.      

Crosby has been at a 100-point pace in 10 of his 19 seasons, just missing the cut on an 11th in 2021/22 when he was just a shade under 100.   

Ranked together:   

1. 20/21 McDavid: 1.88 points per game (56 games)   
2. 22/23 McDavid: 1.87 (82 games)   
3. 23/24 McDavid: 1.69 (59 games so far)    
4. 11/12 Crosby: 1.68 (22 games)

This is just to fully make fun of the dumbass fans bitching about the LTIR. Tampa brought it up in 2015, wasnt changed. Sportsnet said in 2022 Gms arent eagar to change it. Guess why? THE NHL DOESNT HAVE AN ISSUE WITH IT ONLY FANS DO (i personally really dont care)

If a player wants to spent thousands and thousands of dollars and a lot of their time to become a NHL player and then continue to put in that effort to have an NHL job. Theres a real good chance when they go to LTIR they are hurt   


**2022 Avs**

Oh whats that MacKinnon on played 65 regular season games, but wait he played 20 playoff games. Oh now Landeskog played 51 games that season yet also played 20 playoff games. You mean the both Mack and Landeskog could have been on the LTIR the year they won the cup  


**2020 Tampa (we were around for 2021)**

Gee golly. Stamkos played 57, Point and Hedman both played 66 games and Kucherov played 68 games.  Yet Point had 23 playoff games, Kucherov, Hedman had 25 playoff games. Stamkos legit missed playoffs he played 1 game, but he scored  


**2019 Blues**

ROR and Tarasenko were healthy but whats this Perron only played 57 games then scored 16 points in 26 playoff games oh how dare he missed 20+ regular season games, oh now Pietrangelo only played 71 regular season games too, yet played 26 playoff games. Well the Blues must have also cheated. Pietrangelo and Perron didnt play a 80+ games but were around for the playoffs

  
**Capitals (2018)**

Honestly, there top guys played 74 or more game . Oshie missing 8 games i would say is expected. Im shocked Ovi played a full 82

**Pens (2017)**

Oh boy Malkin only played 65 regular season games and Sheary played 61 games. and oh no Letang played 41. Ok letang fully missed playoffs, but oh whats this Malkin played 25 games and had 28 points! and sheary was there for 22 playoff games as well. Well Pens must have cheated, Malkin missed 27 games but played 25 in the playoffs

**Pens 2016 (thats right we went back to back)**

Oh heavens malkin only played 57 games this year. Well i dont need to know he played 23 playoff games posting 18 points to know him missing those 25 regular season games was a big reason why we won and not the HBK line popping off 

**Chicago (2015)**

Oh no Kane only played 61 games in the season guess we should take away the Blackhawks cup. Sharp only played 68 as well. Kane only scored 11 goals and 12 assists in 23 playoff games. Sharp only had 15 points in 23 games too. 

**Kings (2014)**

Toffoli was 8th in regular season season scoring ands was the first one below 77 games aside from Carters 72

**Chicago (2013)**

Lockout season. Hossa is the only one in top 8 regular season scoring under 76 games (he played 40) but sharp at 9th only played 28 game. SOUND THE FREAKING LTIR ALARMS as he went on to play 23 playoff games with 16 points

**Kings (2012)**

74 games was their lowest. It was by Kuznetsov's idol, Mike Richards!

**Bruins (2011)**

Lowest games played was 75 by Krecji unless you want to argue Paille was a key part to the cup in which case he played 43 games scoring 13 points in the regular season

**Chicago (2010)**

Well even in 2010 they abused LTIR Hossa only played 57 games, but the blackhawks won the cup with Hossa playing 22 playoff games and getting 25 points. 

&#x200B;

**Summary:**

since 2010. There has been 7 cup winners who had at least 1 player who was a key part on at least a very good playoff producer to their cup win that missed significant NHL regular season time. It has happened 6 times since Tampa brought up LTIR to the league in 2015.

There are as many teams who have played 64 games in the Pacific as there are teams with 60 games played in the Atlantic, the same goes for 63 and 61 etc. The same thing happens when we compare the Central division and the Metropolitan division.

A player recording a point in all of their team’s home games in a season has been done 4 times before, but only once after the 1921/22 season, and it’s never been done in an 82-game season (with 41 home games).

2. Before that, Babe Dye recorded at least 1 point in all 12 home games the Toronto St. Pats played in the 24-game 1921/22 season. He had 19-3-22 totals.   

3. In the 18-game 1918/19 season, Frank Nighbor had a point in all 9 Ottawa Senators home games, with 11-6-17 totals.   

4. And then, as a technicality in the 22-game 1917/18 season, Jack McDonald was the only Montreal Wanderers player to record a point in all 3 home games they played, with 1 goal in each game… until their arena burned down and the team folded.

For those of you who may be unaware, the PWHL uses the 3-2-1-0 rule for standings, so 3p points for regulation win, 2 for OTW, 1 for OTL and 0 for regulation loss.

"Do you think McDavid will be 3rd or 4th fastest ever to 1,000 points? (Needs 51 points in next 28 games to pass Mike Bossy for 3rd)",https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1b86e99/do_you_think_mcdavid_will_be_3rd_or_4th_fastest/,42,nhl,"McDavid is currently at 949 points in 627 games.   

Gretzky hit 1,000 in his 424th game for fastest ever, and Lemieux hit 1,000 in 513 games for 2nd fastest.   

**What McDavid needs to do to be 3rd fastest**   

3rd on the list is Mike Bossy, who got to 1,000 in his 656th game.   

In order to get to 1,000 by his 655th game, McDavid would need 51 points in his next 28 games (1.82 points per game average). McDavid has 22 games left this season, so his 1,000-point chase will likely go into next season.     

McDavid’s at 1.71 points per game this season, but has averaged over that 1.82 mark in 2 different seasons (1.87 in 2022/23 and 1.88 in 2020/21).   

This season, his highest point total in a 28-game span is 54 points, which ran from Dec. 30 up to last night. And the fewest games it’s taken him to record 51 points in any span this season was 26 games (Jan. 2 up to last night).    

The fewest games it’s ever taken him to rack up 51 points is 20, which was in a 20-game span split across the 2020/21 and 2021/22 seasons. And the most points he’s recorded in a 28-game stretch is 64, again split across the 2020/21 and 2021/22 seasons.         

**What McDavid needs to do to be 4th fastest**   

In order to be the 4th fastest to hit 1,000 points, he’d need to get there in 681 games (Peter Stastny is currently 4th on the list with 1,000 in 682 games).   

To get there faster than Stastny, McDavid needs to record 51 points in his next 54 games, and he’s never been at or under a point per game in any 54-game stretch of his career (worst stretch is 55 points in 54 games in 2016/17).   

And Jari Kurri is 5th fastest with 1,000 points in 716 games, so McDavid would need 51 points in his next 88 games to get there by 715 games. The worst 88-game stretch of McDavid’s career is 93 points in 88 games split across 2015/16 and 2016/17.",2024-03-06 17:59:06,2024-03-06,hot

Xfinity Loses Local NHL Coverage Forever,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1b8hukv/xfinity_loses_local_nhl_coverage_forever/,0,nhl,"In a recent strategic maneuver, as of February 22nd, 2024, Xfinity has transitioned AT&T SportsNet to its ""Ultimate TV Package,"" a decision that notably increases the monthly cost for subscribers by $20. This adjustment places a substantial financial burden on fans of the Pittsburgh Penguins, compelling them to allocate at least $90 monthly solely for the privilege of viewing their beloved team's games from the comfort of their homes. Adding to the complexity, AT&T SportsNet is conspicuously absent from Xfinity's ""Sports Add-on"" package, a decision that sidelines the channel from other sports-focused content such as Redzone and the NHL Network, thereby limiting access for dedicated fans.

This development is symptomatic of a larger, more intricate dynamic within the telecommunications and broadcasting landscape, hinting at an ambitious and long-term strategy potentially in play. The historical context sheds light on a deep-seated rivalry and a series of strategic moves that have shaped the current state of affairs. The origins of this strategic positioning can be traced back to the era of Comcast, previously known as American Cable Systems, which had to rebrand in 2010 due to reputational challenges. The company's strategic territory contracts, established well before the internet's widespread adoption, effectively stifled competition and solidified Comcast's dominance in both cable and internet services.

The narrative takes a fascinating turn with the involvement of SBC Communications, later to become the modern AT&T, a company with a storied history and a significant footprint in telecommunications innovation. Following a period of strategic acquisitions and technological advancements, notably in mobile internet, AT&T re-emerged as a formidable conglomerate, poised to challenge the status quo.

The plot thickens with Comcast's venture into the realm of sports broadcasting, marked by the establishment of Comcast SportsNet. This move, coupled with strategic partnerships and acquisitions, hinted at a broader vision for regional sports dominance. However, the regulatory intervention in the form of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 introduced new dynamics, enabling competitors like AT&T to regain a foothold in the market.

Fast forward to the present, and the landscape of local sports broadcasting is at a critical juncture. AT&T SportsNet's strategic positioning in the NBA and NHL rights, alongside targeted market penetration, suggests a deliberate and calculated approach to reshaping local sports viewership. The avoidance of larger, more expensive markets and a focus on dedicated, regional fanbases indicates a nuanced strategy aimed at gradually eroding Comcast's stronghold, without triggering immediate, large-scale confrontations.

The culmination of these strategic moves hints at an overarching master plan by AT&T, aimed at revolutionizing the local sports broadcasting ecosystem. This vision entails a comprehensive overhaul of how regional sports are accessed and consumed, positioning AT&T as the central nexus for local sports content. By leveraging its technological capabilities, strategic partnerships, and a nuanced understanding of market dynamics, AT&T is poised to offer an unprecedented level of accessibility, quality, and engagement in local sports broadcasting.

In conclusion, AT&T's master plan is not merely about acquiring rights or expanding its portfolio but about fundamentally changing the paradigm of local sports consumption. Through a strategic blend of technological innovation, market acumen, and a deep understanding of consumer needs, AT&T aims to dismantle existing monopolies and establish a new standard for how fans engage with local sports, ultimately seeking to control the entire spectrum of live sports streaming for local professional sports. This bold vision represents a significant shift in the broadcasting landscape, promising to redefine the fan experience and reshape the future of sports entertainment.",2024-03-07 01:41:07,2024-03-07,hot

Really, I don’t know why you all aren’t more angry at your own franchises. Everyone except Tampa voted not to change the rule, which means that all 30 of your other teams knew that the rule was there and still didn’t use it haha. 

None of you would be saying anything if your front offices had the guts to put everything on the table every year.

Your owners are billionaires and won’t open their pockets and load up. Your GMs are too scared of losing their jobs to trade prospects and picks. Fans are too attached to their players to see them get dealt even if there’s someone else better.

Be mad at your own franchises for not doing anything it takes to win. Look at the other major sports, who, by the way, bring in waaay more money than the NHL. This would be nothing in the NBA or MLB.

Prior to 1993, it was very common for Canadian teams to win. 

Is it just by pure chance, or are there structural differences (post mid-90s) between how teams operate between the US and Canada that swing the scales towards teams based in the US?

Edit; thank you for all of your answers and insight, the most common reasons seem to be (in no particular order);

1. Taxes and other financial incentives benefitting US teams more

2. The weather sucks in a number of Canadian NHL-host cities; no one making good money actually wants to live there. 

3. All things being equal, the setup of NHL divisions further reduces the chances of Canadian teams making the finals. 

4. Canadian teams fill stadiums with fans and sell tons of merch regardless if the team is any good. No real incentive to change when fans stick around anyway. 

5. Canadian media/fans hound players, and players can’t live more or less anonymously; nobody wants to play in that environment. Furthermore, US team GMs can make correct decisions for the team without significant interference/scrutiny from the media. 

6. Canada has a smaller free agency pool since many non-Canadians don’t wish to relocate to Canada.

I am SO SICK of all these Pride Night posts!,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/120rhl5/i_am_so_sick_of_all_these_pride_night_posts/,3168,nhl,"Edit: Ok, post has been up long enough and whooshed way more people than I thought it would. This is 100% satire, I tried to be very blatant with it. Reddits gonna Reddit.

If you are LGBTQ+ or an ally and you took this at face value, I'm sorry if this stung at all, and I  understand you see a lot of unironic shit like this often. I wasn't trying to catch any of you as collateral with this. I have nothing but ❤️ for all of you.

If you came here after reading the thread and tried to amplify the bigotry or the homophobia,  or even just to display a complete and total lack of empathy, I hope one day you learn to love yourself so that you can learn to love others ❤️. Seriously, if you hate the posts or the conversation, go make your own subreddit and moderate it yourself - it seems like there's a lot of people who would want to follow you into your echo-chamber, based on the replies here.

----------

So frustrating! I only want to talk about hockey. The things that hockey players say have nothing to do with the sport itself. We shouldn't have interviews. We shouldn't have commentators. Hockey players should be banned from social media. They should live on the rink and sleep on the bench and we should strictly talk about what happens on the ice. This sub should be game highlights only. There are no political issues and no major wars either. Platforms shouldn't be used to spread positive messages, because there are no problems in the world that affect me directly. So why aren't we all just watching hockey? 

But instead, all these people are talking about Pride Night. Every time I see a Pride Night post (which I don't care about btw) I am literally forced to click on it, read the comments and then add my own comment about how much I don't care. It's getting real exhausting clicking on every one of them and telling people how much I don't care. 

Reddit really needs a mechanism for voting on the content we want to see, and maybe even a scroll bar so we can just skip the posts we don't want. I know I'm not the only one who feels this way, because these threads are always filled with people like me, and they show up to every one of those threads to voice their opinion that they don't care and don't want to discuss Pride Night.

Also please ban Senators posts too while you're at it, I don't like the Sens and that content is also irrelevant to me.
