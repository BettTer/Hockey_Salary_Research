"Is this a naturally ""high-scoring era"" with more opportunities available, or are players just more skilled?",https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1br86ae/is_this_a_naturally_highscoring_era_with_more/,6,nhl,"I've seen a lot of people take a bit away from high scorers like Conor McDavid etc. especially compared to older great players like Sidney Crosby, who never got over 120 points in a season, by saying that the eras are different and this is the highest scoring era we've ever seen and so this fact needs to be taken into account when comparing the players.

I don't mind taking that argument seriously if it's true, but what do you think?

Is there something to do with this era and the way that defenses etc. play that makes it easier to score?

Or have players just gotten more skilled at scoring?


I personally can't think of any reason why defenses would have gotten worse overall as the league developed so I have to assume it's the second, but if anyone thinks it's the first and would like to explain why, I'd be interested.",2024-03-30 03:39:18,2024-03-30,new

What's your stance?",https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1bqwk6l/the_hart_race_you_could_make_a_solid_argument_for/,1,nhl,"Personally, I say McDavid. At the rate he is going he is going to win the Art Ross, while being only the 4th player ever to put up 100+ assists, hes on pace for 110 (the other two being Gretzky, Lemieux and Orr). He also became just the 3rd player ever to record 50 primary assists in 50 or less games (49). The other two being Gretzky and Lemieux. Voter fatigue is a real thing though.

MacKinnon has been phenomenal and he benefits from the fact that he's never won it and people just want to see it happen. I do believe he is the least deserving (despite being incredible) but these things do play a factor.

Matthews is unbelievable, I think he needs to get to 70 to win it though, otherwise he is my fourth place vote here. Which is unfortunate given how great he's been.

Kuch could possibly join Connor in the 100 assist club (however unlikely). Even coming close is amazing though. Also, you have to consider his team. It is the MVP and he is absolutely carrying them. The difference between him and the second highest scorer is unreal. He is my very close second.

It seems silly to even consider it. But I really don't know if a player could be called for tripping, or slashing a fellow teammate, for instance. 

I've searched and haven't found a definitive answer. Rule 60.2 specifically states that High Sticking applies if a stick makes contact with an opponent above the shoulders. But do all penalties have to be committed against an opponent?

I love Hockey and I watch it a lot. I'm pretty sure that I have never seen it happen if it can happen.

McDavid's case for the Hart trophy,https://i.redd.it/x0vfnn9sm0rc1.jpeg,0,nhl,"
First off, I'm fully aware of the predictable ""he never won it' bias that will populate the vote for the Hart, especially in the Colorado and Quebec media, the latter one looming large in the vote (Nate played in the Q). This is why I think it's time to start stating the case for McDavid as I believe, with plenty of arguments to support it, that McDavid should be the frontrunner IMHO. If you agree, please share this far and wide.



In order of importance 

1. The Oilers turnaround 

We are all familiar with the story. Despite McDavid and Draisaitl respectively getting 8 and 9 points in the first five games, the team was in complete disarray, bad defensive coverage, inefficient breakouts, getting otfen hemmed in the defensive zone. Nothing seemed to work other than the two juggernauts. After that, McDavid misses two games, two regulation losses, then comes back too quickly, following up with 2 points in 6 games until Woodcroft gets fired and Knoblauch gets hired. The team is 3-9-1 at that point. Knoblauch wins his two first games, loses the next three and McDavid has 6 points in 5 games. The team is 5-12-1 at that point, with McDavid getting a concerning and irregular 16 points in 16 games. 

Then the turnaround happens. 8 wins in a row, then 3 losses, then the great sequence of 16 wins. Since the 16 wins, they've leveled off a bit, playing around .650, with a 14-8-3 record. 

In total, they've been 38-11-3 in the last 52 games, topping the league with 79 points in that sequence (a 125/82 pace), a +27 win differential. 2nd closest was Carolina with 75 in 55, a +20 win differential. To put that into perspective, a team needs +18 in 82 games to get to 100 points. 

In that span, Edmonton led the league in GF/G, was 4th in GA/G, but most importantly, they've had the best +/- differential per game. 

A look at individual results on the team in that span is very revealing: 

McDavid
52gp 20g 83a 103pts
+38 74 primary points 70 ESP 

Draisaitl
52gp 32g 38a 70pts
+26 53 PRP 43 ESP 

Bouchard
52gp 11g 43a 54pts
+34 25 PRP 30 ESP 

Hyman
51gp 41g 12a 53pts
+32 49 PRP 39 ESP 

Nugent-Hopkins
52gp 14g 33a 47pts
+11 32 PRP 26 ESP 

Outscoring Draisaitl by 33 points in 52 games is one thing, but getting as many even-strenght points than Draisaitl had in total points is even more incredible. 

This alone IMO, that sequence since November 24th, makes McDavid the frontrunner. The Hart is supposed to be exactly about this type of accomplishment, literally carrying a team. McDavid participated in 52.3% of Edmonton's goals scored in those 52 games. Unfortunately, this kind of context is foreign to many who rather just look at raw totals, which brings me to number 2 on the list.



2. 50 primary assists in 49 games 

Before I go into this, I have to say I'm still in complete disbelief nobody caught this. Neither the NHL, Edmonton sports media or any other affiliated media has talked about this. No one seemed to notice and yet it's a very rare accomplishment. Primary assists can often be more important than the goal itself. I consider this feat just as amazing as 50/50 goals and its rarity proves that. 

Most would state McDavid's quite probable incoming 100 assists as the second reason, but this feat IMO should overshadow it. From the day the Oilers turnaround started on November 24th, up to last week, on March 21st, Connor had 50 primary assists in 49 games. A 50/50 for primary assists had happened only 11 times before, by only two players. Wayne & Mario. 99 had 9, while 66 did it twice. Last time was Mario Le Magnifique in 1991-1992, more than 30 years ago. The Great One's record for best 50/50 stands at 52 primary assists in 29 games, which he did from December 11th 1985 to Valentine's day in 1986. Mario did it in 47 and 48 games respectively. The closest after Wayne, Mario and now Connor, was Elmer Lach in the famous WW2 league-depleted season of 1944-1945 where his linemate, the Rocket, had the very first 50 goals in 50 games. That season, Lach had 47 primary assists in 50 games. Closest after that is Lafontaine with 44 in 50. After that, it dwindles out with only a few players going around 40 in 50.



3. 71 primary assists 

In the history of the league, only one player has ever had higher than 70 primary assists in a season. Who else than Wayne? In fact, he's the only player to actually finish higher than 1 primary assist per game for a complete season. His record stands at a whopping 112 primary assists. Two players stand at 70. Mario with 70 in 73 games and Joe Thornton with 70 in 81 games. 

Right now, Connor is at 58 on the season and considering he's had 27 of them in his last 22 games, it's feasible that he can end the season with 13 in 12 games, bringing him second only to Wayne.



4. 100++ assists. 

We're all more familiar with this one. Another select group. McDavid might even reach 110 when it's all said and done. He's more than likely to eclipse Bobby Orr and come close to Mario's best season at 114.



5. Back-to-back 60+ primary assists 

60 primary assists or more happened 27 times, by 14 players. Only one player had a back-to-back. In fact, Gretzky had a whopping 11 in a row and an equal 11 in career total. McDavid needs only 2 primary assists in the last 12 games to become the second player to do it. He will also tie Denis Savard with two total. Mario is second to Wayne with 3 seasons of 60+ primary assists.



6. 90 to 95 Even-strenght points 

Johnny Gaudreau had quite a season a few years back, notching 90 even-strenght points. It was the highest finish since Jagr had 95 in 1995-1996. Second to Gaudreau since Jagr is McDavid last year with 84. Right now, Mack has 80, Kuch 79 and McDavid has 78, but the latter had 70 of those 78 in the last 52 games. Out of the three, McDavid is the most likely to pass 90. He needs 17 in his last 12 to catch Jagr, just a notch over his average in the last 52 games.



7. Carrying Hyman 

Now, don't knee-jerk. Hyman's accomplishment is great no matter what, but let's get real here. There are maybe 2 other players in the league who 'might' push Hyman to 50 goals. It's hypothetical. Still, Connor assisted 33 of Hyman's 51 goals so far. 23 of them were primary assists. To contrast this, we often hear how Bobby Orr carried Bucyk to 51 goals by assisting 25 of them.



8. The Art Ross race 

IMO, it would be completely unfair to McDavid to punish him for playing injured early on. Compare McDavid's rates in the last 52 games to Mack and Kuch's entire seasons and a different picture emerges than the tight race we're witnessing right now. It explains why McDavid has made-up so much ground, despite both players having career seasons. 

Pts/Gp
McDavid 1.98
Kucherov 1.75
Mackinnon 1.71 

Primary Pts/Gp
McDavid 1.42
Kucherov 1.28
Mackinnon 1.19 

ESP/Gp
McDavid 1.35
Mackinnon 1.11
Kucherov 1.11 

P/Gp gap with 2nd best teammate
McDavid vs Draisaitl +0.63
Kucherov vs Point +0.61
Mackinnon vs Rantanen +0.36 

Also interesting to note, McDavid's average TOI is 21:29 in those 52 games, which is less than either Kuch or Mack, whether over the entire season or Connor's last 52 games, which means McDavid distanced them even more in terms of per60. 

McDavid's team leading +36 in the last 52 games and all those other stats is the main reason why the Oilers have dominated the league in that span. To me, it's simply a much bigger story than whatever people want to cook-up for Mack or Kuch, but naturally, people will gloss over season totals and proclaim voter fatigue.",2024-03-28 06:03:12,2024-03-28,new

At the rate he is going he is going to win the Art Ross, while being only the 4th player ever to put up 100+ assists, hes on pace for 110 (the other two being Gretzky, Lemieux and Orr). He also became just the 3rd player ever to record 50 primary assists in 50 or less games (49). The other two being Gretzky and Lemieux. Voter fatigue is a real thing though.

MacKinnon has been phenomenal and he benefits from the fact that he's never won it and people just want to see it happen. I do believe he is the least deserving (despite being incredible) but these things do play a factor.

Matthews is unbelievable, I think he needs to get to 70 to win it though, otherwise he is my fourth place vote here. Which is unfortunate given how great he's been.

Kuch could possibly join Connor in the 100 assist club (however unlikely). Even coming close is amazing though. Also, you have to consider his team. It is the MVP and he is absolutely carrying them. The difference between him and the second highest scorer is unreal. He is my very close second.

It seems silly to even consider it. But I really don't know if a player could be called for tripping, or slashing a fellow teammate, for instance. 

I've searched and haven't found a definitive answer. Rule 60.2 specifically states that High Sticking applies if a stick makes contact with an opponent above the shoulders. But do all penalties have to be committed against an opponent?

I love Hockey and I watch it a lot. I'm pretty sure that I have never seen it happen if it can happen.
