However, in terms of importance to their team, it could be argued that no single player is contributing more to their team than Sidney Crosby.  As an example, if you compare where Edmonton would be without McDavid, Tampa without Kucherov, or Colorado without McKinnon, and juxtapose that with where Pittsburgh would be without Crosby, I think the argument is very strong.  The idea of Pittsburgh being within sniffing distance of a playoff spot like they currently are (if they didn't have Crosby) is frankly quite laughable.  This is not to say that he should win it, but I think you can make the case for him to be a finalist.  What do you think?

Edit:  Seems the general consensus is no.  Would your opinion be different if Pens somehow get into the playoffs and Sid recors points on some 60% of Pens goals through the end of the season?",2024-04-02 02:20:40,2024-04-02,new

New Proposed Point Formatting... Thoughts?,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1btgbp7/new_proposed_point_formatting_thoughts/,0,nhl,"Hey everyone,

I was trying to kill some time today and thought about the current scoring format for the NHL standings and thought about a potential change (not that Bettman wants my opinion, lol). I even went as far as calculating standings (i.e., points) with these new totals. 

For calculating ties, any SOW or SOL was considered a tie, given that it was ""past OT"" and would be considered a tie in this new scoring format. I feel like this would be exciting and motivate players to really push for the RW and/or the OW. 

As you can see, the RWs really help some teams (i.e., Winnipeg and New Jersey) and not so much others (i.e., Boston).

Really interested in y'all's' thoughts!

I guess Vegas has some? But they weren’t in the picture at the time of the realignment. If anything the change killed a lot of the most interesting rivalries that featured the Detroit Red Wings.

Last night was my daughter's fifteenth birthday. On the way to the game, I asked her if she wanted to stop and make a poster and she said no it's ok. 
I could tell she just didn't want to cause a fuss but I assured her it was no problem. She agreed. Her sign simply says ""15th birthday, puck please"" 

We get to Amalie two hours early to be among the first in line to get in. Once inside, we rush directly to the warm up area and she puts her sign up on the glass. She is as happy as can be. She has been a lightning super fan for 10 years now. As have I. We don't miss a game together. 

She is having the time of her life. I am watching the warm up clock tick down. Stamkos tosses a puck to a little boy who lights up. Hagel dumps one over to a couple 20 something girls who go wild. Less than two minutes left and the boys start leaving the ice. I know it was a long shot to hope she would get a puck, but I was really hoping my beautiful, selfless, and growing up much to fast daughter, would luck out but maybe just not tonight.

Then Jonas.

He sees her sign, skates over, scoops a puck in his glove and sends it over. I grab it, frozen and covered in ice, and hand it to her, my heart racing. She cries. I cry, Jonas gives a smile so big you can see it through his mask, tilts his head and skates off. 

Jonas, you created a core memory for her. You made a girls birthday wish come true. You made an old dad immeasurably happy beyond words with your simple act of kindness. We are your biggest fans in the world. 

Vasy won the Lightning game last night. You won the game of life and our hearts.
