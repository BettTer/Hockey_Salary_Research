Under 3min left to play in the 3rd period, Panarin scores ENG from Kakko's assist

About 20-30 seconds before the ENG, Kakko's linemates had gone in for the change. Kakko was also going in for the change, after a loong shift (1:10), he was already waving the bench & skating that way -- BUT then he suddenly sees the goalie getting pulled, and stays on the ice with Trochek & Panarin.

* The importance of free agent signings in the NHL has grown significantly since the introduction of the salary cap, with general managers seeing these acquisitions as a key opportunity to bolster their teams. Successful signings can transform a franchise into a contender or even a Stanley Cup winner, while poor decisions can lead to negative consequences, including job loss for the GM.
* The article assesses free agent signings from 2014 onward, evaluating the post-contract performance and team impact of the players involved. It highlights notable cases such as Sebastian Aho's offer sheet situation, the influence of Patrick Maroon's lower-profile signings, Alex Pietrangelo's successful move, Joe Pavelski's performance with Dallas, Zach Hyman's exceeding expectations with Edmonton, Sergei Bobrovsky's contentious but potentially redeeming contract with Florida, John Tavares's hometown return to Toronto, and Artemi Panarin's high-priced yet impactful signing with the New York Rangers.

Thank you Jonas. It meant everything to us.,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1bsdlxh/thank_you_jonas_it_meant_everything_to_us/,373,nhl,"Thank you Jonas. It meant everything to us.

Last night was my daughter's fifteenth birthday. On the way to the game, I asked her if she wanted to stop and make a poster and she said no it's ok. 
I could tell she just didn't want to cause a fuss but I assured her it was no problem. She agreed. Her sign simply says ""15th birthday, puck please"" 

We get to Amalie two hours early to be among the first in line to get in. Once inside, we rush directly to the warm up area and she puts her sign up on the glass. She is as happy as can be. She has been a lightning super fan for 10 years now. As have I. We don't miss a game together. 

She is having the time of her life. I am watching the warm up clock tick down. Stamkos tosses a puck to a little boy who lights up. Hagel dumps one over to a couple 20 something girls who go wild. Less than two minutes left and the boys start leaving the ice. I know it was a long shot to hope she would get a puck, but I was really hoping my beautiful, selfless, and growing up much to fast daughter, would luck out but maybe just not tonight.

Then Jonas.

He sees her sign, skates over, scoops a puck in his glove and sends it over. I grab it, frozen and covered in ice, and hand it to her, my heart racing. She cries. I cry, Jonas gives a smile so big you can see it through his mask, tilts his head and skates off. 

Jonas, you created a core memory for her. You made a girls birthday wish come true. You made an old dad immeasurably happy beyond words with your simple act of kindness. We are your biggest fans in the world. 

Vasy won the Lightning game last night. You won the game of life and our hearts.

Thank you Jonas Johansson #31. Thank you!

Theoretical (not happening this year) Problem with the Divisional Playoff Format,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1bs4ivn/theoretical_not_happening_this_year_problem_with/,0,nhl,"I find it surprising that despite all the people who complain about the playoff format, no one ever mentions the actual prospective problem of it. Whenever we talk about it, we run into the issue of the old 3 division format where the 3rd Division winner was utter trash but got a spot. The question I would have to ask is how is it ""better"" when you can theoretically have the something like the below occur, where the 3rd team in a division could be the 10th best team in the conference, but get grandfathered in. 

Not only would t hat snub (in this heavily fixed example) two teams, it also creates a scenario where the two ""best"" teams in the conference face each other in the 2nd round, (or in a bizarro world where this happens but the Caps still win), the Best team gets an even ""easier"" 2nd round game than the first round.

The issue with the old 3 division winners format was that we had bad teams get a free playoff spot solely  because of a bad division. Now we can get ""bad"" teams into the 2nd round solely because they're in a ""bad"" division.

The question I'd like to posit: how is that better than the previous alternative? How is ""Bad teams"" potentially getting to be in the 2nd round any better than ""bad teams"" getting to be one of the 8 playoff teams? (The example could be worse if I didn't start from the current standings, since it could in theory lead to both 2nd and 3rd in a division being worse than several teams from the other division, if results ended up being crazy enough)

The obvious counter argument is that this example has a very ""level playing field"" in the Met, since somehow 5 teams are within 4 points, but that'd probably serve as a better argument for a different format itself, since higher parity means less need to have guaranteed division spots?",2024-03-31 07:17:32,2024-03-31,new

I am watching the New Jersey vs Buffalo game from    2 / 29 taking place in Buffalo, and they started off with the Canadian anthem.

It's funny because the Leafs played them tonight and it's colloquially known as Toronto's second home since so many do the trip down there.

I'll have to pay attention to games featuring both Canadian teams to see if they also sing the American anthem and if they do, it has to be a relatively recent thing.

He noted how the groundwork for success had been laid in Boston, contrasting with the team in Anaheim where he and his teammates were working to establish a similar standard.
* The Bruins, having clinched a playoff spot after a remarkable regular season, face the challenge of preparing for the postseason with the aim of overcoming past disappointments. Despite not being considered the favorites, the team has the internal expectation of winning their first championship since 2011. Coach Jim Montgomery and captain Brad Marchand emphasize the importance of playing the right way and maintaining consistent preparation to ensure they are ready for the intense competition of the playoffs.

Long



I'm new to the sport betting I figured I know enough when to throw a team with high reward for a win,  it's worth it like my friends back home favorites the ny islanders were facing the high volatile Florida panthers, I knew Bob panthers starter lost 6 last starts, but the back won his last 6, I don't think the panthers play as good as most think really no depth on other line 1. Now the islanders chasing the wildcard (I want them to make it, I enjoy when my friends are happy) but you got Detroit Red wing's who recently lost 7 games so that a possible of 14 points! If they won all that's 93 pts, or even 3 of 7 for 6pts would be 1 behind tampa bay lightning @ 86 for the 2nd or last wild card and 3-5 pts from 3 place..anyway my friends ol islanders are in desperate need to take advantage of the Detroit Red wing's mediocre offense and goaltending..this is the time to keep winning fuck the red wings as much as I'd hate to see Washington Capital's get removed from the wild card spot, I don't think the ones the call NY Rangers of the South, Tampa bay shouldn't be knocked also Carolina hurricanes are also a team who would normally use alot of ex rangers its weird but they won't catch Toronto Mapleleafs or do we call them a 4 man show(Mathews, Nylander, Marner, Tavares) let me show an insane stat - accounted for a total of $40,489,366 of the Leafs' salary cap. It was a staggering 49.7 percent. For just 4 players! I feel the leaf fans frustration so say 80million was the cap for signings that's insane 4 players take 40,500,000 out of a 23 man roster that leaves 19 players to figure out the other 51% I can understand the leaf fans frustration, a team wins the cup, atleast 3 lines, can get away with a bad or okay 4th line, but what about defense only 3 I have heard up with a solid d man at 40yr old(Giordano) basically a waste of a possible playoff team....I may bite my words but even with a round 1 win they absolutely won't be able to win this cup..so since the islanders won me some money and I would love to see a eastern conference final NY Islanders vs NY Rangers...I'll keep betting on my friends from home's team most games are under dogs...win you silly team! As a rangers fan I remember 1994 atleast first 2 periods my dad woke me up screaming yes yes yes! I want my friends born in the early 80 mid 80s to see them hoist a cup for you islanders fans too! And I'm going to throw a future prediction ok so first one if Connor McDavid doesn't win a cup with the Oilers, some time in the future he signs with the rangers ( only if they don't end up winning a cup by then) another is if the rangers win a cup by the time mathews is a free agent he will definitely go to the rangers",2024-03-30 08:14:02,2024-03-30,new

I don't mind taking that argument seriously if it's true, but what do you think?

Is there something to do with this era and the way that defenses etc. play that makes it easier to score?

Or have players just gotten more skilled at scoring?

Last night was my daughter's fifteenth birthday. On the way to the game, I asked her if she wanted to stop and make a poster and she said no it's ok. 
I could tell she just didn't want to cause a fuss but I assured her it was no problem. She agreed. Her sign simply says ""15th birthday, puck please"" 

We get to Amalie two hours early to be among the first in line to get in. Once inside, we rush directly to the warm up area and she puts her sign up on the glass. She is as happy as can be. She has been a lightning super fan for 10 years now. As have I. We don't miss a game together. 

She is having the time of her life. I am watching the warm up clock tick down. Stamkos tosses a puck to a little boy who lights up. Hagel dumps one over to a couple 20 something girls who go wild. Less than two minutes left and the boys start leaving the ice. I know it was a long shot to hope she would get a puck, but I was really hoping my beautiful, selfless, and growing up much to fast daughter, would luck out but maybe just not tonight.

Then Jonas.

He sees her sign, skates over, scoops a puck in his glove and sends it over. I grab it, frozen and covered in ice, and hand it to her, my heart racing. She cries. I cry, Jonas gives a smile so big you can see it through his mask, tilts his head and skates off. 

Jonas, you created a core memory for her. You made a girls birthday wish come true. You made an old dad immeasurably happy beyond words with your simple act of kindness. We are your biggest fans in the world. 

Vasy won the Lightning game last night. You won the game of life and our hearts.

* The importance of free agent signings in the NHL has grown significantly since the introduction of the salary cap, with general managers seeing these acquisitions as a key opportunity to bolster their teams. Successful signings can transform a franchise into a contender or even a Stanley Cup winner, while poor decisions can lead to negative consequences, including job loss for the GM.
* The article assesses free agent signings from 2014 onward, evaluating the post-contract performance and team impact of the players involved. It highlights notable cases such as Sebastian Aho's offer sheet situation, the influence of Patrick Maroon's lower-profile signings, Alex Pietrangelo's successful move, Joe Pavelski's performance with Dallas, Zach Hyman's exceeding expectations with Edmonton, Sergei Bobrovsky's contentious but potentially redeeming contract with Florida, John Tavares's hometown return to Toronto, and Artemi Panarin's high-priced yet impactful signing with the New York Rangers.

Theoretical (not happening this year) Problem with the Divisional Playoff Format,https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1bs4ivn/theoretical_not_happening_this_year_problem_with/,0,nhl,"I find it surprising that despite all the people who complain about the playoff format, no one ever mentions the actual prospective problem of it. Whenever we talk about it, we run into the issue of the old 3 division format where the 3rd Division winner was utter trash but got a spot. The question I would have to ask is how is it ""better"" when you can theoretically have the something like the below occur, where the 3rd team in a division could be the 10th best team in the conference, but get grandfathered in. 

Not only would t hat snub (in this heavily fixed example) two teams, it also creates a scenario where the two ""best"" teams in the conference face each other in the 2nd round, (or in a bizarro world where this happens but the Caps still win), the Best team gets an even ""easier"" 2nd round game than the first round.

The issue with the old 3 division winners format was that we had bad teams get a free playoff spot solely  because of a bad division. Now we can get ""bad"" teams into the 2nd round solely because they're in a ""bad"" division.

The question I'd like to posit: how is that better than the previous alternative? How is ""Bad teams"" potentially getting to be in the 2nd round any better than ""bad teams"" getting to be one of the 8 playoff teams? (The example could be worse if I didn't start from the current standings, since it could in theory lead to both 2nd and 3rd in a division being worse than several teams from the other division, if results ended up being crazy enough)

The obvious counter argument is that this example has a very ""level playing field"" in the Met, since somehow 5 teams are within 4 points, but that'd probably serve as a better argument for a different format itself, since higher parity means less need to have guaranteed division spots?",2024-03-31 07:17:32,2024-03-31,hot

I am watching the New Jersey vs Buffalo game from    2 / 29 taking place in Buffalo, and they started off with the Canadian anthem.

It's funny because the Leafs played them tonight and it's colloquially known as Toronto's second home since so many do the trip down there.

I'll have to pay attention to games featuring both Canadian teams to see if they also sing the American anthem and if they do, it has to be a relatively recent thing.

"Is this a naturally ""high-scoring era"" with more opportunities available, or are players just more skilled?",https://www.reddit.com/r/nhl/comments/1br86ae/is_this_a_naturally_highscoring_era_with_more/,19,nhl,"I've seen a lot of people take a bit away from high scorers like Conor McDavid etc. especially compared to older great players like Sidney Crosby, who never got over 120 points in a season, by saying that the eras are different and this is the highest scoring era we've ever seen and so this fact needs to be taken into account when comparing the players.

I don't mind taking that argument seriously if it's true, but what do you think?

Is there something to do with this era and the way that defenses etc. play that makes it easier to score?

Or have players just gotten more skilled at scoring?


I personally can't think of any reason why defenses would have gotten worse overall as the league developed so I have to assume it's the second, but if anyone thinks it's the first and would like to explain why, I'd be interested.",2024-03-30 03:39:18,2024-03-30,hot
